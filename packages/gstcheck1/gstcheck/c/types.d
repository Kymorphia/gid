/**
    #GstHarness is meant to make writing unit test for GStreamer much easier.
  It can be thought of as a way of treating a #GstElement as a black box,
  deterministically feeding it data, and controlling what data it outputs.
  
  The basic structure of #GstHarness is two "floating" #GstPads that connect
  to the harnessed #GstElement src and sink #GstPads like so:
  
  ```
            __________________________
   _____   |  _____            _____  |   _____
  |     |  | |     |          |     | |  |     |
  | src |--+-| sink|  Element | src |-+--| sink|
  |_____|  | |_____|          |_____| |  |_____|
           |__________________________|
  
  ```
  
  With this, you can now simulate any environment the #GstElement might find
  itself in. By specifying the #GstCaps of the harness #GstPads, using
  functions like [gstcheck.harness.Harness.setSrcCaps] or [gstcheck.harness.Harness.setSinkCapsStr],
  you can test how the #GstElement interacts with different caps sets.
  
  Your harnessed #GstElement can of course also be a bin, and using
  [gstcheck.harness.Harness.newParse] supporting standard gst-launch syntax, you can
  easily test a whole pipeline instead of just one element.
  
  You can then go on to push #GstBuffers and #GstEvents on to the srcpad,
  using functions like [gstcheck.harness.Harness.push] and [gstcheck.harness.Harness.pushEvent], and
  then pull them out to examine them with [gstcheck.harness.Harness.pull] and
  [gstcheck.harness.Harness.pullEvent].
  
  ## A simple buffer-in buffer-out example
  
  ```c
    #include <gst/gst.h>
    #include <gst/check/gstharness.h>
    GstHarness *h;
    GstBuffer *in_buf;
    GstBuffer *out_buf;
  
    // attach the harness to the src and sink pad of GstQueue
    h = gst_harness_new ("queue");
  
    // we must specify a caps before pushing buffers
    gst_harness_set_src_caps_str (h, "mycaps");
  
    // create a buffer of size 42
    in_buf = gst_harness_create_buffer (h, 42);
  
    // push the buffer into the queue
    gst_harness_push (h, in_buf);
  
    // pull the buffer from the queue
    out_buf = gst_harness_pull (h);
  
    // validate the buffer in is the same as buffer out
    fail_unless (in_buf == out_buf);
  
    // cleanup
    gst_buffer_unref (out_buf);
    gst_harness_teardown (h);
  
    ```
  
  Another main feature of the #GstHarness is its integration with the
  #GstTestClock. Operating the #GstTestClock can be very challenging, but
  #GstHarness simplifies some of the most desired actions a lot, like wanting
  to manually advance the clock while at the same time releasing a #GstClockID
  that is waiting, with functions like [gstcheck.harness.Harness.crankSingleClockWait].
  
  #GstHarness also supports sub-harnesses, as a way of generating and
  validating data. A sub-harness is another #GstHarness that is managed by
  the "parent" harness, and can either be created by using the standard
  gst_harness_new type functions directly on the (GstHarness *)->src_harness,
  or using the much more convenient [gstcheck.harness.Harness.addSrc] or
  [gstcheck.harness.Harness.addSinkParse]. If you have a decoder-element you want to test,
  (like vp8dec) it can be very useful to add a src-harness with both a
  src-element (videotestsrc) and an encoder (vp8enc) to feed the decoder data
  with different configurations, by simply doing:
  
  ```c
    GstHarness * h = gst_harness_new ("vp8dec");
    gst_harness_add_src_parse (h, "videotestsrc is-live=1 ! vp8enc", TRUE);
  ```
  
  and then feeding it data with:
  
  ```c
  gst_harness_push_from_src (h);
  ```

/**
    GstTestClock is an implementation of #GstClock which has different
  behaviour compared to #GstSystemClock. Time for #GstSystemClock advances
  according to the system time, while time for #GstTestClock changes only
  when [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.setTime] or [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.advanceTime] are
  called. #GstTestClock provides unit tests with the possibility to
  precisely advance the time in a deterministic manner, independent of the
  system time or any other external factors.
  
  ## Advancing the time of a #GstTestClock
  
  ```c
    #include <gst/gst.h>
    #include <gst/check/gsttestclock.h>
  
    GstClock *clock;
    GstTestClock *test_clock;
  
    clock = gst_test_clock_new ();
    test_clock = GST_TEST_CLOCK (clock);
    GST_INFO ("Time: %" GST_TIME_FORMAT, GST_TIME_ARGS (gst_clock_get_time (clock)));
    gst_test_clock_advance_time ( test_clock, 1 * GST_SECOND);
    GST_INFO ("Time: %" GST_TIME_FORMAT, GST_TIME_ARGS (gst_clock_get_time (clock)));
    g_usleep (10 * G_USEC_PER_SEC);
    GST_INFO ("Time: %" GST_TIME_FORMAT, GST_TIME_ARGS (gst_clock_get_time (clock)));
    gst_test_clock_set_time (test_clock, 42 * GST_SECOND);
    GST_INFO ("Time: %" GST_TIME_FORMAT, GST_TIME_ARGS (gst_clock_get_time (clock)));
    ...
  ```
  
  #GstClock allows for setting up single shot or periodic clock notifications
  as well as waiting for these notifications synchronously (using
  [gst.clock.Clock.idWait]) or asynchronously (using [gst.clock.Clock.idWaitAsync] or
  [gst.clock.Clock.idWaitAsync]). This is used by many GStreamer elements,
  among them #GstBaseSrc and #GstBaseSink.
  
  #GstTestClock keeps track of these clock notifications. By calling
  [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.waitForNextPendingId] or
  [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.waitForMultiplePendingIds] a unit tests may wait for the
  next one or several clock notifications to be requested. Additionally unit
  tests may release blocked waits in a controlled fashion by calling
  [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.processNextClockId]. This way a unit test can control the
  inaccuracy (jitter) of clock notifications, since the test can decide to
  release blocked waits when the clock time has advanced exactly to, or past,
  the requested clock notification time.
  
  There are also interfaces for determining if a notification belongs to a
  #GstTestClock or not, as well as getting the number of requested clock
  notifications so far.
  
  N.B.: When a unit test waits for a certain amount of clock notifications to
  be requested in [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.waitForNextPendingId] or
  [gstcheck.test_clock.TestClock.waitForMultiplePendingIds] then these functions may block
  for a long time. If they block forever then the expected clock notifications
  were never requested from #GstTestClock, and so the assumptions in the code
  of the unit test are wrong. The unit test case runner in gstcheck is
  expected to catch these cases either by the default test case timeout or the
  one set for the unit test by calling tcase_set_timeout\(\).
  
  The sample code below assumes that the element under test will delay a
  buffer pushed on the source pad by some latency until it arrives on the sink
  pad. Moreover it is assumed that the element will at some point call
  [gst.clock.Clock.idWait] to synchronously wait for a specific time. The first
  buffer sent will arrive exactly on time only delayed by the latency. The
  second buffer will arrive a little late (7ms) due to simulated jitter in the
  clock notification.
  
  ## Demonstration of how to work with clock notifications and #GstTestClock
  
  ```c

    GST_INFO ("Validate that element produced an output buffer and check its timestamp\n");
    g_assert_cmpint (get_number_of_output_buffer (...), ==, 1);
    buf = get_buffer_pushed_by_element (element, ...);
    g_assert_cmpint (GST_BUFFER_TIMESTAMP (buf), ==, latency);
    gst_buffer_unref (buf);
    GST_INFO ("Check that element does not wait for any clock notification\n");
    g_assert (!gst_test_clock_peek_next_pending_id (test_clock, NULL));
  
    GST_INFO ("Set time, create and push the second buffer\n");
    gst_test_clock_advance_time (test_clock, 10 * GST_SECOND);
    buf = create_test_buffer (gst_clock_get_time (clock), ...);
    gst_assert_cmpint (gst_pad_push (srcpad, buf), ==, GST_FLOW_OK);
  
    GST_INFO ("Block until element is waiting for a new clock notification\n");
    (gst_test_clock_wait_for_next_pending_id (test_clock, &pending_id);
    GST_INFO ("Advance past 7ms beyond the requested time of the clock notification\n");
    gst_test_clock_advance_time (test_clock, latency + 7 * GST_MSECOND);
    GST_INFO ("Release the next blocking wait and make sure it is the one from element\n");
    processed_id = gst_test_clock_process_next_clock_id (test_clock);
    g_assert (processed_id == pending_id);
    g_assert_cmpint (GST_CLOCK_ENTRY_STATUS (processed_id), ==, GST_CLOCK_OK);
    gst_clock_id_unref (pending_id);
    gst_clock_id_unref (processed_id);
  
    GST_INFO ("Validate that element produced an output buffer and check its timestamp\n");
    g_assert_cmpint (get_number_of_output_buffer (...), ==, 1);
    buf = get_buffer_pushed_by_element (element, ...);
    g_assert_cmpint (GST_BUFFER_TIMESTAMP (buf), ==,
        10 * GST_SECOND + latency + 7 * GST_MSECOND);
    gst_buffer_unref (buf);
    GST_INFO ("Check that element does not wait for any clock notification\n");
    g_assert (!gst_test_clock_peek_next_pending_id (test_clock, NULL));
    ...
  ```
  
  Since #GstTestClock is only supposed to be used in unit tests it calls
  g_assert(), g_assert_cmpint() or g_assert_cmpuint() to validate all function
  arguments. This will highlight any issues with the unit test code itself.
