    #cairo_raster_source_acquire_func_t is the type of function which is
  called when a pattern is being rendered from. It should create a surface
  that provides the pixel data for the region of interest as defined by
  extents, though the surface itself does not have to be limited to that
  area. For convenience the surface should probably be of image type,

  device). Another option, might be to return a similar surface to the
  target for explicit handling by the application of a set of cached sources
  on the device. The region of sample data provided should be defined using

  sample data (along with width and height of the surface).

/**
    #cairo_user_scaled_font_init_func_t is the type of function which is
  called when a scaled-font needs to be created for a user font-face.
  
  The cairo context cr is not used by the caller, but is prepared in font
  space, similar to what the cairo contexts passed to the render_glyph
  method will look like.  The callback can use this context for extents
  computation for example.  After the callback is called, cr is checked
  for any error status.
  
  The extents argument is where the user font sets the font extents for
  scaled_font.  It is in font space, which means that for most cases its
  ascent and descent members should add to 1.0.  extents is preset to
  hold a value of 1.0 for ascent, height, and max_x_advance, and 0.0 for
  descent and max_y_advance members.
  
  The callback is optional.  If not set, default font extents as described
  in the previous paragraph will be used.
  
  Note that scaled_font is not fully initialized at this
  point and trying to use it for text operations in the callback will result
  in deadlock.

  ## Parameters
  $(LIST
    * $(B scaledFont)       the scaled-font being created
    * $(B cr)       a cairo context, in font space
    * $(B extents)       font extents to fill in, in font space
  )
  Returns:     [cairo.types.Status.success] upon success, or an error status on error.

/**
    #cairo_user_scaled_font_render_glyph_func_t is the type of function which
  is called when a user scaled-font needs to render a glyph.
  
  The callback is mandatory, and expected to draw the glyph with code glyph to
  the cairo context cr.  cr is prepared such that the glyph drawing is done in
  font space.  That is, the matrix set on cr is the scale matrix of scaled_font.
  The extents argument is where the user font sets the font extents for
  scaled_font.  However, if user prefers to draw in user space, they can
  achieve that by changing the matrix on cr.
  
  All cairo rendering operations to cr are permitted. However, when
  this callback is set with
  [cairo.global.userFontFaceSetRenderGlyphFunc], the result is
  undefined if any source other than the default source on cr is
  used.  That means, glyph bitmaps should be rendered using
  [cairo.context.Context.mask] instead of [cairo.context.Context.paint].
  
  When this callback is set with
  [cairo.global.userFontFaceSetRenderColorGlyphFunc], the default
  source is black. Setting the source is a valid
  operation. [cairo.global.userScaledFontGetForegroundMarker] or
  [cairo.global.userScaledFontGetForegroundSource] may be called to
  obtain the current source at the time the glyph is rendered.
  
  Other non-default settings on cr include a font size of 1.0 (given that
  it is set up to be in font space), and font options corresponding to
  scaled_font.
  
  The extents argument is preset to have <literal>x_bearing</literal>,
  <literal>width</literal>, and <literal>y_advance</literal> of zero,
  <literal>y_bearing</literal> set to <literal>-font_extents.ascent</literal>,
  <literal>height</literal> to <literal>font_extents.ascent+font_extents.descent</literal>,
  and <literal>x_advance</literal> to <literal>font_extents.max_x_advance</literal>.
  The only field user needs to set in majority of cases is
  <literal>x_advance</literal>.
  If the <literal>width</literal> field is zero upon the callback returning
  (which is its preset value), the glyph extents are automatically computed
  based on the drawings done to cr.  This is in most cases exactly what the
  desired behavior is.  However, if for any reason the callback sets the
  extents, it must be ink extents, and include the extents of all drawing
  done to cr in the callback.
  
  Where both color and non-color callbacks has been set using
  [cairo.global.userFontFaceSetRenderColorGlyphFunc], and
  [cairo.global.userFontFaceSetRenderGlyphFunc], the color glyph
  callback will be called first. If the color glyph callback returns
  [cairo.types.Status.userFontNotImplemented], any drawing operations are
  discarded and the non-color callback will be called. This is the
  only case in which the [cairo.types.Status.userFontNotImplemented] may
  be returned from a render callback. This fallback sequence allows a
  user font face to contain a combination of both color and non-color
  glyphs.

  ## Parameters
  $(LIST
    * $(B scaledFont)       user scaled-font
    * $(B glyph)       glyph code to render
    * $(B cr)       cairo context to draw to, in font space
    * $(B extents)       glyph extents to fill in, in font space
  )
  Returns:     [cairo.types.Status.success] upon success,
    [cairo.types.Status.userFontNotImplemented] if fallback options should be tried,
    or [cairo.types.Status.userFontError] or any other error status on error.

/**
    #cairo_user_scaled_font_unicode_to_glyph_func_t is the type of function which
  is called to convert an input Unicode character to a single glyph.
  This is used by the [cairo.context.Context.showText] operation.
  
  This callback is used to provide the same functionality as the
  text_to_glyphs callback does (see #cairo_user_scaled_font_text_to_glyphs_func_t)
  but has much less control on the output,
  in exchange for increased ease of use.  The inherent assumption to using
  this callback is that each character maps to one glyph, and that the
  mapping is context independent.  It also assumes that glyphs are positioned
  according to their advance width.  These mean no ligatures, kerning, or
  complex scripts can be implemented using this callback.
  
  The callback is optional, and only used if text_to_glyphs callback is not
  set or fails to return glyphs.  If this callback is not set or if it returns
  [cairo.types.Status.userFontNotImplemented], an identity mapping from Unicode
  code-points to glyph indices is assumed.
  
  Note: While cairo does not impose any limitation on glyph indices,
  some applications may assume that a glyph index fits in a 16-bit
  unsigned integer.  As such, it is advised that user-fonts keep their
  glyphs in the 0 to 65535 range.  Furthermore, some applications may
  assume that glyph 0 is a special glyph-not-found glyph.  User-fonts
  are advised to use glyph 0 for such purposes and do not use that
  glyph value for other purposes.

  ## Parameters
  $(LIST
    * $(B scaledFont)       the scaled-font being created
    * $(B unicode)       input unicode character code-point
    * $(B glyphIndex)       output glyph index
  )
  Returns:     [cairo.types.Status.success] upon success,
    [cairo.types.Status.userFontNotImplemented] if fallback options should be tried,
    or [cairo.types.Status.userFontError] or any other error status on error.
