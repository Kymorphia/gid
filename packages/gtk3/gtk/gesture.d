/**
    #GtkGesture is the base object for gesture recognition, although this
  object is quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures,
  it is suitable to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using
  the special null #GdkEventSequence value for these).
  
  The number of touches that a #GtkGesture need to be recognized is controlled
  by the #GtkGesture:n-points property, if a gesture is keeping track of less
  or more than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture
  is recognized.
  
  As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
  run the #GtkGesture::check signal regularly on input events until the gesture
  is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
  #GtkGesture subclasses.
  
  A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
  $(LIST
    * #GtkGesture::begin when the gesture is recognized.
    * A number of #GtkGesture::update, whenever an input event is processed.
    * #GtkGesture::end when the gesture is no longer recognized.
  )
    
  ## Event propagation
  
  In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
  through [gtk.event_controller.EventController.setPropagationPhase], or feed those manually
  through [gtk.event_controller.EventController.handleEvent].
  
  In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
  target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
  get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
  
  After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional #GtkWidget::button-press-event,
  #GtkWidget::button-release-event, #GtkWidget::touch-event, etc signals. Gestures
  with the [gtk.types.PropagationPhase.Target] phase are fed events from the default #GtkWidget::event
  handlers.
  
  In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
  toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get
  a chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
  
  ## States of a sequence # {#touch-sequence-states}
  
  Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
  #GtkGestures, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and
  in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the
  widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly
  in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the #GdkEventSequences
  triggering those.
  
  Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through [gtk.gesture.Gesture.group],
  grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
  [gtk.gesture.Gesture.setSequenceState] on one will effectively propagate
  the state throughout the group.
  
  By default, all sequences start out in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
  sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
  propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
  
  If a sequence enters into the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
  group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
  through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
  the touch is active.
  
  If a sequence enters in the #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture
  group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
  $(LIST
    * Setting the same sequence to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other gesture
      group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the propagation
      chain.
    * calling #GtkGesture::cancel on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
      propagation chain.
    * Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
  )
    
  Note: if a sequence is set early to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
  #GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN/#GDK_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before
  reaching the event widget, this implies #GTK_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar
  event will emulated if the sequence changes to #GTK_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED.
  This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
  again.
  
  Sequence states can't be changed freely, see [gtk.gesture.Gesture.setSequenceState]
  to know about the possible lifetimes of a #GdkEventSequence.
  
  ## Touchpad gestures
  
  On the platforms that support it, #GtkGesture will handle transparently
  touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of #GtkGesture should do
  to enable this support are:
  $(LIST
    * Enabling [gdk.types.EventMask.TouchpadGestureMask] on their #GdkWindows
    * If the gesture has [gtk.types.PropagationPhase.None], ensuring events of type
      [gdk.types.EventType.TouchpadSwipe] and [gdk.types.EventType.TouchpadPinch] are handled by the #GtkGesture
  )
