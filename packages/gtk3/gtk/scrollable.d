/**
    #GtkScrollable is an interface that is implemented by widgets with native
    scrolling ability.
    
    To implement this interface you should override the
    #GtkScrollable:hadjustment and #GtkScrollable:vadjustment properties.
    
    ## Creating a scrollable widget
    
    All scrollable widgets should do the following.
    
    $(LIST
      * When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
        the widget should populate the adjustments’
        #GtkAdjustment:lower, #GtkAdjustment:upper,
        #GtkAdjustment:step-increment, #GtkAdjustment:page-increment and
        #GtkAdjustment:page-size properties and connect to the
        #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal.
      
      * Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
        the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
        This means that it must accept any value passed to its
        #GtkWidgetClass.size_allocate() function.
      
      * When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
        the widget should update the adjustments’ properties with new values.
      
      * When any of the adjustments emits the #GtkAdjustment::value-changed signal,
        the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.
