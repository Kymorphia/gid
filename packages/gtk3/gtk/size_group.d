/**
    #GtkSizeGroup provides a mechanism for grouping a number of widgets
    together so they all request the same amount of space.  This is
    typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the same
    size, but you can’t use a #GtkGrid widget.
    
    In detail, the size requested for each widget in a #GtkSizeGroup is
    the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
    widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode
    of the size group (see [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup.setMode]) determines whether
    this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.
    
    Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
    the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
    a #GtkSizeGroup to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
    such a way that they get the size they request and not more. For
    example, if you are packing your widgets into a table, you would not
    include the [gtk.types.AttachOptions.Fill] flag.
    
    #GtkSizeGroup objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
    so once you have added all widgets to a #GtkSizeGroup, you can drop
    the initial reference to the size group with [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.unref]. If the
    widgets in the size group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
    be removed from the size group and drop their references on the size
    group; when all widgets have been removed, the size group will be
    freed.
    
    Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK+ will compute the
    horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all
    widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups
    of type [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Horizontal] or [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Both], and the
    vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
    reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
    [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Vertical] or [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Both].
    
    Note that only non-contextual sizes of every widget are ever consulted
    by size groups (since size groups have no knowledge of what size a widget
    will be allocated in one dimension, it cannot derive how much height
    a widget will receive for a given width). When grouping widgets that
    trade height for width in mode [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Vertical] or [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Both]:
    the height for the minimum width will be the requested height for all
    widgets in the group. The same is of course true when horizontally grouping
    width for height widgets.
    
    Widgets that trade height-for-width should set a reasonably large minimum width
    by way of #GtkLabel:width-chars for instance. Widgets with static sizes as well
    as widgets that grow (such as ellipsizing text) need no such considerations.
    
    # GtkSizeGroup as GtkBuildable
    
    Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
    element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
    widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
    that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
    size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.
    
    An example of a UI definition fragment with GtkSizeGroup:
    
    ```xml
    <object class="GtkSizeGroup">
      <property name="mode">GTK_SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL</property>
      <widgets>
        <widget name="radio1"/>
        <widget name="radio2"/>
      </widgets>
    </object>
    ```
