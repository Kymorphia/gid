/**
 * The #GtkEditable interface is an interface which should be implemented by
 * text editing widgets, such as #GtkEntry and #GtkSpinButton. It contains functions
 * for generically manipulating an editable widget, a large number of action
 * signals used for key bindings, and several signals that an application can
 * connect to to modify the behavior of a widget.
 * As an example of the latter usage, by connecting
 * the following handler to #GtkEditable::insert-text, an application
 * can convert all entry into a widget into uppercase.
 * ## Forcing entry to uppercase.
