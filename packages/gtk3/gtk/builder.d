/**
    A GtkBuilder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions
    of a user interface and instantiates the described objects. To create
    a GtkBuilder from a user interface description, call
    [gtk.builder.Builder.newFromFile], [gtk.builder.Builder.newFromResource] or
    [gtk.builder.Builder.newFromString].
    
    In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
    descriptions from multiple sources to the same GtkBuilder you can
    call [gtk.builder.Builder.new_] to get an empty builder and populate it by
    (multiple) calls to [gtk.builder.Builder.addFromFile],
    [gtk.builder.Builder.addFromResource] or [gtk.builder.Builder.addFromString].
    
    A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
    and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
    cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
    contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
    builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call [gtk.widget.Widget.destroy]
    to get rid of them and all the widgets they contain.
    
    The functions [gtk.builder.Builder.getObject] and [gtk.builder.Builder.getObjects]
    can be used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned
    to them inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these
    functions will stay around until the user explicitly destroys them
    with [gtk.widget.Widget.destroy]. Other widgets will either be part of a
    larger hierarchy constructed by the builder (in which case you should
    not have to worry about their lifecycle), or without a parent, in which
    case they have to be added to some container to make use of them.
    Non-widget objects need to be reffed with [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.ref_] to keep them
    beyond the lifespan of the builder.
    
    The function [gtk.builder.Builder.connectSignals] and variants thereof can be
    used to connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
    
    # GtkBuilder UI Definitions # {#BUILDER-UI}
    
    GtkBuilder parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
    specified in an XML format which can be roughly described by the
    RELAX NG schema below. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
    UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
    Do not confuse GtkBuilder UI Definitions with
    [GtkUIManager UI Definitions][XML-UI], which are more limited in scope.
    It is common to use `.ui` as the filename extension for files containing
    GtkBuilder UI definitions.
    
    [RELAX NG Compact Syntax](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/gtk/gtkbuilder.rnc)
    
    The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
    attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
    using dgettext() in the domain specified. This can also be done by
    calling [gtk.builder.Builder.setTranslationDomain] on the builder.
    Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
    `<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
    connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
    child objects (most often widgets inside a container, but also e.g.
    actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model). A `<child>`
    element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
    The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
    the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
    the only supported value is “gtk+”) and the “version” attribute specifies
    the target version in the form `<major>.<minor>`. The builder will error
    out if the version requirements are not met.
    
    Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
    element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
    been loaded yet, GTK+ tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
    class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
    necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the get_type() function
    explictly with the "type-func" attribute. As a special case, GtkBuilder
    allows to use an object that has been constructed by a #GtkUIManager in
    another part of the UI definition by specifying the id of the #GtkUIManager
    in the “constructor” attribute and the name of the object in the “id”
    attribute.
    
    Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
    application to retrieve them from the builder with [gtk.builder.Builder.getObject].
    An id is also necessary to use the object as property value in other
    parts of the UI definition. GTK+ reserves ids starting and ending
    with `___` (3 underscores) for its own purposes.
    
    Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
    `<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
    property, and the content of the element specifies the value.
    If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK+ uses
    gettext() (or dgettext() if the builder has a translation domain set)
    to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
    is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
    probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
    specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
    may help the translators.
    
    GtkBuilder can parse textual representations for the most common
    property types: characters, strings, integers, floating-point numbers,
    booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
    as true, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
    as false), enumerations (can be specified by their name, nick or
    integer value), flags (can be specified by their name, nick, integer
    value, optionally combined with “|”, e.g. “GTK_VISIBLE|GTK_REALIZED”)
    and colors (in a format understood by [gdk.rgba.RGBA.parse]).
    
    GVariants can be specified in the format understood by [glib.variant.Variant.parse],
    and pixbufs can be specified as a filename of an image file to load.
    
    Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
    objects declared in the local xml fragment and objects exposed via
    [gtk.builder.Builder.exposeObject]. In general, GtkBuilder allows forward
    references to objects — declared in the local xml; an object doesn’t
    have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The exception
    to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before it can
    be used as the value of a construct-only property.
    
    It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
    property value using the attributes
    "bind-source" to specify the source object of the binding,
    "bind-property" to specify the source property and optionally
    "bind-flags" to specify the binding flags.
    Internally builder implements this using GBinding objects.
    For more information see [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.bindProperty]
    
    Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
    attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
    specifies the function to connect to the signal. By default, GTK+ tries
    to find the handler using [gmodule.module_.Module.symbol], but this can be changed by
    passing a custom #GtkBuilderConnectFunc to
    [gtk.builder.Builder.connectSignalsFull]. The remaining attributes, “after”,
    “swapped” and “object”, have the same meaning as the corresponding
    parameters of the [gobject.global.signalConnectObject] or
    [gobject.global.signalConnectData] functions. A “last_modification_time”
    attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the
    builder.
    
    Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
    been constructed by GTK+ as part of a composite widget, to set
    properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the @vbox of
    a #GtkDialog). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
    property of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that GtkBuilder
    still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
    has already been constructed.
    
    A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
    (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
    a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
    The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
    sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.
    
    # A GtkBuilder UI Definition
    
    ```xml
    <interface>
      <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
        <child internal-child="vbox">
          <object class="GtkBox" id="vbox1">
            <property name="border-width">10</property>
            <child internal-child="action_area">
              <object class="GtkButtonBox" id="hbuttonbox1">
                <property name="border-width">20</property>
                <child>
                  <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                    <property name="label">gtk-ok</property>
                    <property name="use-stock">TRUE</property>
                    <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
                  </object>
                </child>
              </object>
            </child>
          </object>
        </child>
      </object>
    </interface>
    ```
    
    Beyond this general structure, several object classes define their
    own XML DTD fragments for filling in the ANY placeholders in the DTD
    above. Note that a custom element in a `<child>` element gets parsed by
    the custom tag handler of the parent object, while a custom element in
    an `<object>` element gets parsed by the custom tag handler of the object.
    
    These XML fragments are explained in the documentation of the
    respective objects.
    
    Additionally, since 3.10 a special `<template>` tag has been added
    to the format allowing one to define a widget class’s components.
    See the [GtkWidget documentation][composite-templates] for details.

      This method is a simpler variation of [gtk.builder.Builder.connectSignalsFull].
      It uses symbols explicitly added to builder with prior calls to
      [gtk.builder.Builder.addCallbackSymbol]. In the case that symbols are not
      explicitly added; it uses #GModule’s introspective features (by opening the module null)
      to look at the application’s symbol table. From here it tries to match
      the signal handler names given in the interface description with
      symbols in the application and connects the signals. Note that this
      function can only be called once, subsequent calls will do nothing.
      
      Note that unless [gtk.builder.Builder.addCallbackSymbol] is called for
      all signal callbacks which are referenced by the loaded XML, this
      function will require that #GModule be supported on the platform.
      
      If you rely on #GModule support to lookup callbacks in the symbol table,
      the following details should be noted:
      
      When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
      with #G_MODULE_EXPORT, or they will not be put in the symbol table.
      On Linux and Unices, this is not necessary; applications should instead
      be compiled with the -Wl,--export-dynamic CFLAGS, and linked against
