/**
    #GtkApplication is a class that handles many important aspects
  of a GTK+ application in a convenient fashion, without enforcing
  a one-size-fits-all application model.
  
  Currently, GtkApplication handles GTK+ initialization, application
  uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
  desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
  list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
  life-cycle of your application.
  
  While GtkApplication works fine with plain #GtkWindows, it is recommended
  to use it together with #GtkApplicationWindow.
  
  When GDK threads are enabled, GtkApplication will acquire the GDK
  lock when invoking actions that arrive from other processes.  The GDK
  lock is not touched for local action invocations.  In order to have
  actions invoked in a predictable context it is therefore recommended
  that the GDK lock be held while invoking actions locally with
  [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.activateAction].  The same applies to actions
  associated with #GtkApplicationWindow and to the “activate” and
  “open” #GApplication methods.
  
  ## Automatic resources ## {#automatic-resources}
  
  #GtkApplication will automatically load menus from the #GtkBuilder
  resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
  resource base path (see [gio.application.Application.setResourceBasePath]).  The
  menu with the ID "app-menu" is taken as the application's app menu
  and the menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
  menubar.  Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
  and accessed via [gtk.application.Application.getMenuById] which allows for
  dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
  
  If the resources "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" or "gtk/menus-traditional.ui" are
  present then these files will be used in preference, depending on the value
  of [gtk.application.Application.prefersAppMenu]. If the resource "gtk/menus-common.ui"
  is present it will be loaded as well. This is useful for storing items that
  are referenced from both "gtk/menus-appmenu.ui" and
  "gtk/menus-traditional.ui".
  
  It is also possible to provide the menus manually using
  [gtk.application.Application.setAppMenu] and [gtk.application.Application.setMenubar].
  
  #GtkApplication will also automatically setup an icon search path for
  the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
  path.  This allows your application to easily store its icons as
  resources.  See [gtk.icon_theme.IconTheme.addResourcePath] for more
  information.
  
  If there is a resource located at "gtk/help-overlay.ui" which
  defines a #GtkShortcutsWindow with ID "help_overlay" then GtkApplication
  associates an instance of this shortcuts window with each
  #GtkApplicationWindow and sets up keyboard accelerators (Control-F1
  and Control-?) to open it. To create a menu item that displays the
  shortcuts window, associate the item with the action win.show-help-overlay.
  
  ## A simple application ## {#gtkapplication}
  
  [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/blob/gtk-3-24/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
  
  GtkApplication optionally registers with a session manager
  of the users session (if you set the #GtkApplication:register-session
  property) and offers various functionality related to the session
  life-cycle.
  
  An application can block various ways to end the session with
  the [gtk.application.Application.inhibit] function. Typical use cases for
  this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
  such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
  manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
  inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
  session while inhibitors are present.

      Creates a new #GtkApplication instance.
    
    When using #GtkApplication, it is not necessary to call [gtk.global.init_]
    manually. It is called as soon as the application gets registered as
    the primary instance.
    
    Concretely, [gtk.global.init_] is called in the default handler for the
    #GApplication::startup signal. Therefore, #GtkApplication subclasses should
    chain up in their #GApplication::startup handler before using any GTK+ API.
    
    Note that commandline arguments are not passed to [gtk.global.init_].
    All GTK+ functionality that is available via commandline arguments
    can also be achieved by setting suitable environment variables
    such as `G_DEBUG`, so this should not be a big
    problem. If you absolutely must support GTK+ commandline arguments,
    you can explicitly call [gtk.global.init_] before creating the application
    instance.
    
    If non-null, the application ID must be valid.  See
    [gio.application.Application.idIsValid].
    
    If no application ID is given then some features (most notably application
    uniqueness) will be disabled. A null application ID is only allowed with
    GTK+ 3.6 or later.

    GtkApplication also extracts accelerators out of “accel” attributes

    than calling this function for each accelerator.
