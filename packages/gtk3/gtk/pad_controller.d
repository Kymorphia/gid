/**
    #GtkPadController is an event controller for the pads found in drawing
    tablets (The collection of buttons and tactile sensors often found around
    the stylus-sensitive area).
    
    These buttons and sensors have no implicit meaning, and by default they
    perform no action, this event controller is provided to map those to
    #GAction objects, thus letting the application give those a more semantic
    meaning.
    
    Buttons and sensors are not constrained to triggering a single action, some
    [gdk.types.InputSource.TabletPad] devices feature multiple "modes", all these input
    elements have one current mode, which may determine the final action
    being triggered. Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups,
    all elements in a group share the same current mode, but different groups
    may have different modes. See [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getNGroups] and
    [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getGroupNModes].
    
    Each of the actions that a given button/strip/ring performs for a given
    mode is defined by #GtkPadActionEntry, it contains an action name that
    will be looked up in the given #GActionGroup and activated whenever the
    specified input element and mode are triggered.
    
    A simple example of #GtkPadController usage, assigning button 1 in all
    modes and pad devices to an "invert-selection" action:
    ```
      GtkPadActionEntry *pad_actions[] = {
        { GTK_PAD_ACTION_BUTTON, 1, -1, "Invert selection", "pad-actions.invert-selection" },
        …
      };
    
      …
      action_group = g_simple_action_group_new ();
      action = g_simple_action_new ("pad-actions.invert-selection", NULL);
      g_signal_connect (action, "activate", on_invert_selection_activated, NULL);
      g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (action_group), action);
      …
      pad_controller = gtk_pad_controller_new (window, action_group, NULL);
    ```
    
    The actions belonging to rings/strips will be activated with a parameter
    of type `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE` bearing the value of the given axis, it
    is required that those are made stateful and accepting this #GVariantType.

      Creates a new #GtkPadController that will associate events from pad to

      guaranteed.
      
      The #GtkPadController is created with no mapped actions. In order to map pad
      events to actions, use [gtk.pad_controller.PadController.setActionEntries] or
