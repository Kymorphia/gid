/**
    The #GtkClipboard object represents a clipboard of data shared
  between different processes or between different widgets in
  the same process. Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a
  #GdkAtom. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with
  [gdk.atom.Atom.intern] and [gdk.atom.Atom.name].) The default clipboard
  corresponds to the “CLIPBOARD” atom; another commonly used clipboard
  is the “PRIMARY” clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains
  the currently selected text.
  
  To support having a number of different formats on the clipboard
  at the same time, the clipboard mechanism allows providing
  callbacks instead of the actual data.  When you set the contents
  of the clipboard, you can either supply the data directly (via
  functions like [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.setText]), or you can supply a
  callback to be called at a later time when the data is needed (via
  [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.setWithData] or [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.setWithOwner].)
  Providing a callback also avoids having to make copies of the data
  when it is not needed.
  
  [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.setWithData] and [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.setWithOwner]
  are quite similar; the choice between the two depends mostly on
  which is more convenient in a particular situation.
  The former is most useful when you want to have a blob of data
  with callbacks to convert it into the various data types that you
  advertise. When the @clear_func you provided is called, you
  simply free the data blob. The latter is more useful when the
  contents of clipboard reflect the internal state of a #GObject
  (As an example, for the PRIMARY clipboard, when an entry widget
  provides the clipboard’s contents the contents are simply the
  text within the selected region.) If the contents change, the
  entry widget can call [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.setWithOwner] to update
  the timestamp for clipboard ownership, without having to worry
  about @clear_func being called.
  
  Requesting the data from the clipboard is essentially
  asynchronous. If the contents of the clipboard are provided within
  the same process, then a direct function call will be made to
  retrieve the data, but if they are provided by another process,
  then the data needs to be retrieved from the other process, which
  may take some time. To avoid blocking the user interface, the call
  to request the selection, [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.requestContents] takes a
  callback that will be called when the contents are received (or
  when the request fails.) If you don’t want to deal with providing
  a separate callback, you can also use [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.waitForContents].
  What this does is run the GLib main loop recursively waiting for
  the contents. This can simplify the code flow, but you still have
  to be aware that other callbacks in your program can be called
  while this recursive mainloop is running.
  
  Along with the functions to get the clipboard contents as an
  arbitrary data chunk, there are also functions to retrieve
  it as text, [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.requestText] and
  [gtk.clipboard.Clipboard.waitForText]. These functions take care of
  determining which formats are advertised by the clipboard
  provider, asking for the clipboard in the best available format
  and converting the results into the UTF-8 encoding. (The standard
  form for representing strings in GTK+.)

    (`GDK_NONE` is supported as a synonym for GDK_SELECTION_CLIPBOARD
    for backwards compatibility reasons.)
    The currently-selected object or text should be provided on the clipboard
    identified by #GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY. Cut/copy/paste menu items
    conceptually copy the contents of the #GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY clipboard
    to the default clipboard, i.e. they copy the selection to what the
    user sees as the clipboard.
    
    (Passing #GDK_NONE is the same as using `gdk_atom_intern
    ("CLIPBOARD", FALSE)`.
    
    See the
    [FreeDesktop Clipboard Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/clipboards-spec)
    for a detailed discussion of the “CLIPBOARD” vs. “PRIMARY”
    selections under the X window system. On Win32 the
    #GDK_SELECTION_PRIMARY clipboard is essentially ignored.)
    
    It’s possible to have arbitrary named clipboards; if you do invent
    new clipboards, you should prefix the selection name with an
    underscore (because the ICCCM requires that nonstandard atoms are
    underscore-prefixed), and namespace it as well. For example,
    if your application called “Foo” has a special-purpose
    clipboard, you might call it “_FOO_SPECIAL_CLIPBOARD”.
