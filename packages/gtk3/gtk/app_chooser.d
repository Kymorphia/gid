/**
    #GtkAppChooser is an interface that can be implemented by widgets which
    allow the user to choose an application (typically for the purpose of
    opening a file). The main objects that implement this interface are
    #GtkAppChooserWidget, #GtkAppChooserDialog and #GtkAppChooserButton.
    
    Applications are represented by GIO #GAppInfo objects here.
    GIO has a concept of recommended and fallback applications for a
    given content type. Recommended applications are those that claim
    to handle the content type itself, while fallback also includes
    applications that handle a more generic content type. GIO also
    knows the default and last-used application for a given content
    type. The #GtkAppChooserWidget provides detailed control over
    whether the shown list of applications should include default,
    recommended or fallback applications.
    
    To obtain the application that has been selected in a #GtkAppChooser,
    use [gtk.app_chooser.AppChooser.getAppInfo].
