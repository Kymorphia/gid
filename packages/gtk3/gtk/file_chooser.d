/**
    #GtkFileChooser is an interface that can be implemented by file
    selection widgets.  In GTK+, the main objects that implement this
    interface are #GtkFileChooserWidget, #GtkFileChooserDialog, and
    #GtkFileChooserButton.  You do not need to write an object that
    implements the #GtkFileChooser interface unless you are trying to
    adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming
    interface.
    
    #GtkFileChooser allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
    In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
    may be a bit confusing at first that these shortcuts come from various
    sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:
    
    $(LIST
      * Bookmarks: are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
        right pane to the left pane, or by using the “Add”. Bookmarks
        can be renamed and deleted by the user.
      
      * Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
        program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
        cannot be modified by the user.
      
      * Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
        the “roots” of the filesystem.
    )
      
    # File Names and Encodings
    
    When the user is finished selecting files in a
    #GtkFileChooser, your program can get the selected names
    either as filenames or as URIs.  For URIs, the normal escaping
    rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters.
    However, filenames are always returned in
    the character set specified by the
    `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` environment variable.
    Please see the GLib documentation for more details about this
    variable.
    
    This means that while you can pass the result of
    [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.getFilename] to [glib.global.open] or [glib.global.fopen],
    you may not be able to directly set it as the text of a
    #GtkLabel widget unless you convert it first to UTF-8,
    which all GTK+ widgets expect. You should use [glib.global.filenameToUtf8]
    to convert filenames into strings that can be passed to GTK+
    widgets.
    
    # Adding a Preview Widget
    
    You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then
    get notification about when the preview needs to be updated.
    To install a preview widget, use
    [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setPreviewWidget].  Then, connect to the
    #GtkFileChooser::update-preview signal to get notified when
    you need to update the contents of the preview.
    
    Your callback should use
    [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.getPreviewFilename] to see what needs
    previewing.  Once you have generated the preview for the
    corresponding file, you must call
    [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setPreviewWidgetActive] with a boolean
    flag that indicates whether your callback could successfully
    generate a preview.
    
    ## Example: Using a Preview Widget ## {#gtkfilechooser-preview}
    ```c
    {
      GtkImage *preview;
    
      ...
    
      preview = gtk_image_new ();
    
      gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget (my_file_chooser, preview);
      g_signal_connect (my_file_chooser, "update-preview",
    		    G_CALLBACK (update_preview_cb), preview);
    }
    
    static void
    update_preview_cb (GtkFileChooser *file_chooser, gpointer data)
    {
      GtkWidget *preview;
      char *filename;
      GdkPixbuf *pixbuf;
      gboolean have_preview;
    
      preview = GTK_WIDGET (data);
      filename = gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename (file_chooser);
    
      pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file_at_size (filename, 128, 128, NULL);
      have_preview = (pixbuf != NULL);
      g_free (filename);
    
      gtk_image_set_from_pixbuf (GTK_IMAGE (preview), pixbuf);
      if (pixbuf)
        g_object_unref (pixbuf);
    
      gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active (file_chooser, have_preview);
    }
    ```
    
    # Adding Extra Widgets
    
    You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
    that are not present in the default design.  For example, you
    can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a
    file in read-only mode.  You can use
    [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setExtraWidget] to insert additional
    widgets in a file chooser.
    
    An example for adding extra widgets:
    ```c
    
      GtkWidget *toggle;
    
      ...
    
      toggle = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Open file read-only");
      gtk_widget_show (toggle);
      gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget (my_file_chooser, toggle);
    }
    ```
    
    If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file
    chooser, you can a container such as a #GtkBox or a #GtkGrid
    and include your widgets in it.  Then, set the container as
    the whole extra widget.
