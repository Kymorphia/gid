/**
    A GtkWindow is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
  Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
  of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
  (resize it, move it, close it,...).
  
  # GtkWindow as GtkBuildable
  
  The GtkWindow implementation of the #GtkBuildable interface supports a
  custom `<accel-groups>` element, which supports any number of `<group>`
  elements representing the #GtkAccelGroup objects you want to add to
  your window (synonymous with [gtk.window.Window.addAccelGroup].
  
  It also supports the `<initial-focus>` element, whose name property names
  the widget to receive the focus when the window is mapped.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment with accel groups:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkWindow">
    <accel-groups>
      <group name="accelgroup1"/>
    </accel-groups>
    <initial-focus name="thunderclap"/>
  </object>
  
  ...
  
  <object class="GtkAccelGroup" id="accelgroup1"/>
  ```
  
  The GtkWindow implementation of the #GtkBuildable interface supports
  setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
  attribute of a `<child>` element.
  
  # CSS nodes
  
  ```plain
  window.background
  ├── decoration
  ├── <titlebar child>.titlebar [.default-decoration]
  ╰── <child>
  ```
  
  GtkWindow has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background,
  and a subnode with name decoration.
  
  Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
  client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
  without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
  decorations). GtkWindow also represents window states with the following
  style classes on the main node: .tiled, .maximized, .fullscreen. Specialized
  types of window often add their own discriminating style classes, such as
  .popup or .tooltip.
  
  GtkWindow adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
  widget that is added as a titlebar child.

    dialogs, though in some other toolkits dialogs are called “popups”.

      This function returns the position you need to pass to
    [gtk.window.Window.move] to keep window in its current position.
    This means that the meaning of the returned value varies with
    window gravity. See [gtk.window.Window.move] for more details.
    
    The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system
    currently in use. Some windowing systems, such as Wayland, do not
    support a global coordinate system, and thus the position of the
    window will always be (0, 0). Others, like X11, do not have a reliable
    way to obtain the geometry of the decorations of a window if they are
    provided by the window manager. Additionally, on X11, window manager
    have been known to mismanage window gravity, which result in windows
    moving even if you use the coordinates of the current position as
    returned by this function.
    
    If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
    #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that [gtk.window.Window.getPosition]
    gets the position of the top-left corner of the window manager
    frame for the window. [gtk.window.Window.move] sets the position of this
    same top-left corner.
    
    If a window has gravity #GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
    frame is not relevant, and thus [gtk.window.Window.getPosition] will
    always produce accurate results. However you can’t use static
    gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
    because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
    
    Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the
    window has client side decorations, assuming that the windowing
    system supports global coordinates.
    
    In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
    applications, as they lack enough knowledge of the windowing
    system and the window manager state to effectively do so. The
    appropriate way to implement saving the window position is to
    use a platform-specific protocol, wherever that is available.

      Obtains the current size of window.
    
    If window is not visible on screen, this function return the size GTK+
    will suggest to the [window manager][gtk-X11-arch] for the initial window
    size (but this is not reliably the same as the size the window manager
    will actually select). See: [gtk.window.Window.setDefaultSize].
    
    Depending on the windowing system and the window manager constraints,
    the size returned by this function may not match the size set using
    [gtk.window.Window.resize]; additionally, since [gtk.window.Window.resize] may be
    implemented as an asynchronous operation, GTK+ cannot guarantee in any
    way that this code:
    
    ```c
      // width and height are set elsewhere
      gtk_window_resize (window, width, height);
    
      int new_width, new_height;
      gtk_window_get_size (window, &new_width, &new_height);
    ```
    
    will result in `new_width` and `new_height` matching `width` and
    `height`, respectively.
    
    This function will return the logical size of the #GtkWindow,
    excluding the widgets used in client side decorations; there is,
    however, no guarantee that the result will be completely accurate
    because client side decoration may include widgets that depend on
    the user preferences and that may not be visibile at the time you
    call this function.
    
    The dimensions returned by this function are suitable for being
    stored across sessions; use [gtk.window.Window.setDefaultSize] to
    restore them when before showing the window.
    
    To avoid potential race conditions, you should only call this
    function in response to a size change notification, for instance
    inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal, or
    inside a handler for the #GtkWidget::configure-event signal:
    
    ```c
    static void
    on_size_allocate (GtkWidget *widget, GtkAllocation *allocation)
    {
      int new_width, new_height;
    
      gtk_window_get_size (GTK_WINDOW (widget), &new_width, &new_height);
    
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    Note that, if you connect to the #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal,
    you should not use the dimensions of the #GtkAllocation passed to
    the signal handler, as the allocation may contain client side
    decorations added by GTK+, depending on the windowing system in
    use.
    
    If you are getting a window size in order to position the window
    on the screen, you should, instead, simply set the window’s semantic
    type with [gtk.window.Window.setTypeHint], which allows the window manager
    to e.g. center dialogs. Also, if you set the transient parent of
    dialogs with [gtk.window.Window.setTransientFor] window managers will
    often center the dialog over its parent window. It's much preferred
    to let the window manager handle these cases rather than doing it
    yourself, because all apps will behave consistently and according to
    user or system preferences, if the window manager handles it. Also,
    the window manager can take into account the size of the window
    decorations and border that it may add, and of which GTK+ has no
    knowledge. Additionally, positioning windows in global screen coordinates
    may not be allowed by the windowing system. For more information,
    see: [gtk.window.Window.setPosition].

    honor requests after the window has already been shown.
    
    Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determined
    reference point for the window. The gravity determines two things:
    first, the location of the reference point in root window
    coordinates; and second, which point on the window is positioned at
    the reference point.
    
    By default the gravity is #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the reference
    point is simply the x, y supplied to [gtk.window.Window.move]. The
    top-left corner of the window decorations (aka window frame or
    border) will be placed at x, y.  Therefore, to position a window
    at the top left of the screen, you want to use the default gravity
    (which is #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to 0,0.
    
    To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you
    would set #GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the reference
    point is at x + the window width and y + the window height, and
    the bottom-right corner of the window border will be placed at that
    reference point. So, to place a window in the bottom right corner
    you would first set gravity to south east, then write:
    `gtk_window_move (window, gdk_screen_width () - window_width,
    gdk_screen_height () - window_height)` (note that this
    example does not take multi-head scenarios into account).

    Unlike [gtk.widget.Widget.setSizeRequest], which sets a size request for

    function only sets the initial size, just as if the user had
    resized the window themselves. Users can still shrink the window
    again as they normally would. Setting a default size of -1 means to

    For more control over a window’s initial size and how resizing works,

    For some uses, [gtk.window.Window.resize] is a more appropriate function.
    [gtk.window.Window.resize] changes the current size of the window, rather
    than the size to be used on initial display. [gtk.window.Window.resize] always
    affects the window itself, not the geometry widget.
    
    The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is
    shown; if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size
    it had prior to hiding, rather than using the default size.
    
    Windows can’t actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
    passing 0 for width and height is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.
    
    If you use this function to reestablish a previously saved window size,
    note that the appropriate size to save is the one returned by
    [gtk.window.Window.getSize]. Using the window allocation directly will not
    work in all circumstances and can lead to growing or shrinking windows.
