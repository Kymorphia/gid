/**
    The #GtkDrawingArea widget is used for creating custom user interface
  elements. It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
  creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:
  
  $(LIST
    * Mouse and button press signals to respond to input from
      the user. (Use [gtk.widget.Widget.addEvents] to enable events
      you wish to receive.)
    
    * The #GtkWidget::realize signal to take any necessary actions
      when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
      (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)
    
    * The #GtkWidget::size-allocate signal to take any necessary
      actions when the widget changes size.
    
    * The #GtkWidget::draw signal to handle redrawing the
      contents of the widget.
  )
    
  The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
  area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
  color.
  
  Note that GDK automatically clears the exposed area before sending
  the expose event, and that drawing is implicitly clipped to the exposed
  area. If you want to have a theme-provided background, you need
  to call [gtk.global.renderBackground] in your ::draw method.
  
  ## Simple GtkDrawingArea usage
  
  ```c
  gboolean
  draw_callback (GtkWidget *widget, cairo_t *cr, gpointer data)
  {
    guint width, height;
    GdkRGBA color;
    GtkStyleContext *context;
  
    context = gtk_widget_get_style_context (widget);
  
    width = gtk_widget_get_allocated_width (widget);
    height = gtk_widget_get_allocated_height (widget);
  
    gtk_render_background (context, cr, 0, 0, width, height);
  
    cairo_arc (cr,
               width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
               MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
               0, 2 * G_PI);
  
    gtk_style_context_get_color (context,
                                 gtk_style_context_get_state (context),
                                 &color);
    gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);
  
    cairo_fill (cr);
  
   return FALSE;
  }
  [...]
    GtkWidget *drawing_area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
    gtk_widget_set_size_request (drawing_area, 100, 100);
    g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (drawing_area), "draw",
                      G_CALLBACK (draw_callback), NULL);
  ```
  
  Draw signals are normally delivered when a drawing area first comes
  onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
  You can also force an expose event by adding to the “damage region”
  of the drawing area’s window; [gtk.widget.Widget.queueDrawArea] and
  [gdk.window.Window.invalidateRect] are equally good ways to do this.
  You’ll then get a draw signal for the invalid region.
  
  The available routines for drawing are documented on the
  [GDK Drawing Primitives][gdk3-Cairo-Interaction] page
  and the cairo documentation.
  
  To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable
  them with [gtk.widget.Widget.addEvents]. To receive keyboard events, you
  will need to set the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you
  should probably draw some user-visible indication that the drawing
  area is focused. Use [gtk.widget.Widget.hasFocus] in your expose event
  handler to decide whether to draw the focus indicator. See
  [gtk.global.renderFocus] for one way to draw focus.
