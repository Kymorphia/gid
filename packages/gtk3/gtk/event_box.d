  /**
      Set whether the event box uses a visible or invisible child
      window. The default is to use visible windows.
      
      In an invisible window event box, the window that the
      event box creates is a [gdk.types.WindowWindowClass.InputOnly] window, which
      means that it is invisible and only serves to receive
      events.
      
      A visible window event box creates a visible ([gdk.types.WindowWindowClass.InputOutput])
      window that acts as the parent window for all the widgets
      contained in the event box.
      
      You should generally make your event box invisible if
      you just want to trap events. Creating a visible window
      may cause artifacts that are visible to the user, especially
      if the user is using a theme with gradients or pixmaps.
      
      The main reason to create a non input-only event box is if
      you want to set the background to a different color or
      draw on it.
      
      There is one unexpected issue for an invisible event box that has its
      window below the child. (See [gtk.event_box.EventBox.setAboveChild].)
      Since the input-only window is not an ancestor window of any windows
      that descendent widgets of the event box create, events on these
      windows aren’t propagated up by the windowing system, but only by GTK+.
      The practical effect of this is if an event isn’t in the event
      mask for the descendant window (see [gtk.widget.Widget.addEvents]),
      it won’t be received by the event box.
      
      This problem doesn’t occur for visible event boxes, because in
      that case, the event box window is actually the ancestor of the
      descendant windows, not just at the same place on the screen.
  
      Params:
        visibleWindow = true to make the event box have a visible window
