/**
    GtkBuildable allows objects to extend and customize their deserialization
  from [GtkBuilder UI descriptions][BUILDER-UI].
  The interface includes methods for setting names and properties of objects,
  parsing custom tags and constructing child objects.
  
  The GtkBuildable interface is implemented by all widgets and
  many of the non-widget objects that are provided by GTK+. The
  main user of this interface is #GtkBuilder. There should be
  very little need for applications to call any of these functions directly.
  
  An object only needs to implement this interface if it needs to extend the
  #GtkBuilder format or run any extra routines at deserialization time.
