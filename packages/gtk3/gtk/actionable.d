/**
    This interface provides a convenient way of associating widgets with
  actions on a #GtkApplicationWindow or #GtkApplication.
  
  It primarily consists of two properties: #GtkActionable:action-name
  and #GtkActionable:action-target. There are also some convenience APIs
  for setting these properties.
  
  The action will be looked up in action groups that are found among
  the widgets ancestors. Most commonly, these will be the actions with
  the “win.” or “app.” prefix that are associated with the #GtkApplicationWindow
  or #GtkApplication, but other action groups that are added with
  [gtk.widget.Widget.insertActionGroup] will be consulted as well.

    The target value has two purposes.  First, it is used as the
    parameter to activation of the action associated with the
    #GtkActionable widget. Second, it is used to determine if the widget
    should be rendered as “active” — the widget is active if the state
    is equal to the given target.
    
    Consider the example of associating a set of buttons with a #GAction
    with string state in a typical “radio button” situation.  Each button
    will be associated with the same action, but with a different target
    value for that action.  Clicking on a particular button will activate
    the action with the target of that button, which will typically cause
    the action’s state to change to that value.  Since the action’s state
    is now equal to the target value of the button, the button will now
    be rendered as active (and the other buttons, with different targets,
    rendered inactive).

      targetValue =       a #GVariant to set as the target value, or null
