/**
    A #GtkTreeModelFilter is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
    and can do the following things:
    
    $(LIST
      * Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
        storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
        or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
        model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
        row should be filtered or not.
      
      * Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
        This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
        values and also for creating a completely different model based
        on the given child model.
      
      * Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
        in a #GtkTreePath indicating the root node for the filter at construction
        time.
    )
      
    The basic API is similar to #GtkTreeModelSort. For an example on its usage,
    see the section on #GtkTreeModelSort.
    
    When using #GtkTreeModelFilter, it is important to realize that
    #GtkTreeModelFilter maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
    visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
    exposed by the child model. #GtkTreeModelFilter will not cache the entire
    child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
    that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
    implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
    because of reference counting rule 3, see the #GtkTreeModel
    documentation. (Note that e.g. #GtkTreeStore does not implement
    reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
    the receiving node is not visible).
    
    Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
    In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
    the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
    or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
    node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
    When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
    nodes (see reference couting rule number 3 in the #GtkTreeModel section).
    
    Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
    of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
    #GtkTreeModelFilter explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
    does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
    As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
    last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.
    
    This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
    to accommodate this, #GtkTreeModelFilter must make sure the necessary
    signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
    for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to #GtkTreeModelFilter's
    clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
    in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
    row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
    was not cached), #GtkTreeModelFilter will check if the visibility state
    of any parent node has changed.
    
    Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
    cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
    in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
    own. In this case, either rely on #GtkTreeStore to emit all signals
    because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
    do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
    yourself.
