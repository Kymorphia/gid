/**
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable] is a simple interface used by GTK to represent content that
    can be painted.
    
    The content of a [gdk.paintable.Paintable] can be painted anywhere at any size
    without requiring any sort of layout. The interface is inspired by
    similar concepts elsewhere, such as
    [ClutterContent](https://developer.gnome.org/clutter/stable/ClutterContent.html),
    [HTML/CSS Paint Sources](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/#paint-source),
    or [SVG Paint Servers](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html).
    
    A [gdk.paintable.Paintable] can be snapshot at any time and size using
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.snapshot]. How the paintable interprets that size and
    if it scales or centers itself into the given rectangle is implementation
    defined, though if you are implementing a [gdk.paintable.Paintable] and don't know what
    to do, it is suggested that you scale your paintable ignoring any potential
    aspect ratio.
    
    The contents that a [gdk.paintable.Paintable] produces may depend on the [gdk.snapshot.Snapshot]
    passed to it. For example, paintables may decide to use more detailed images
    on higher resolution screens or when OpenGL is available. A [gdk.paintable.Paintable]
    will however always produce the same output for the same snapshot.
    
    A [gdk.paintable.Paintable] may change its contents, meaning that it will now produce
    a different output with the same snapshot. Once that happens, it will call
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateContents] which will emit the
    `signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-contents` signal. If a paintable is known
    to never change its contents, it will set the [gdk.types.PaintableFlags.Contents]
    flag. If a consumer cannot deal with changing contents, it may call
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.getCurrentImage] which will return a static
    paintable and use that.
    
    A paintable can report an intrinsic (or preferred) size or aspect ratio it
    wishes to be rendered at, though it doesn't have to. Consumers of the interface
    can use this information to layout thepaintable appropriately. Just like the
    contents, the size of a paintable can change. A paintable will indicate this
    by calling [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateSize] which will emit the
    `signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-size` signal. And just like for contents,
    if a paintable is known to never change its size, it will set the
    [gdk.types.PaintableFlags.Size] flag.
    
    Besides API for applications, there are some functions that are only
    useful for implementing subclasses and should not be used by applications:
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateContents],
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateSize],
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.newEmpty].
