    Positioning hints for aligning a surface relative to a rectangle.

    the surface would fall off-screen if placed in its ideal position.
    
    For example, [gdk.types.AnchorHints.FlipX] will replace [gdk.types.Gravity.NorthWest] with
    [gdk.types.Gravity.NorthEast] and vice versa if the surface extends beyond the left
    or right edges of the monitor.
    
    If [gdk.types.AnchorHints.SlideX] is set, the surface can be shifted horizontally to fit
    on-screen. If [gdk.types.AnchorHints.ResizeX] is set, the surface can be shrunken
    horizontally to fit.
    
    In general, when multiple flags are set, flipping should take precedence over
    sliding, which should take precedence over resizing.

    A [gdk.content_formats.ContentFormats] describes a set of possible formats content can be

    important than mime types. Order between different `GTypes` or mime types
    is the order they were added in, most important first. Functions that
    care about order, such as [gdk.content_formats.ContentFormats.union_], will describe

    [gdk.cursor.Cursor] is used to create and destroy cursors.
    
    Cursors are immutable objects, so once you created them, there is no way
    to modify them later. You should create a new cursor when you want to change
    something about it.
    
    Cursors by themselves are not very interesting: they must be bound to a
    window for users to see them. This is done with [gdk.surface.Surface.setCursor]
    or [gdk.surface.Surface.setDeviceCursor]. Applications will typically
    use higher-level GTK functions such as [[gtk.widget.Widget.setCursor]](../gtk4/method.Widget.set_cursor.html)
    instead.
    
    Cursors are not bound to a given [gdk.display.Display], so they can be shared.
    However, the appearance of cursors may vary when used on different
    platforms.
    
    ## Named and texture cursors
    
    There are multiple ways to create cursors. The platform's own cursors
    can be created with [gdk.cursor.Cursor.newFromName]. That function lists
    the commonly available names that are shared with the CSS specification.
    Other names may be available, depending on the platform in use. On some
    platforms, what images are used for named cursors may be influenced by
    the cursor theme.
    
    Another option to create a cursor is to use [gdk.cursor.Cursor.newFromTexture]
    and provide an image to use for the cursor.
    
    To ease work with unsupported cursors, a fallback cursor can be provided.
    If a [gdk.surface.Surface] cannot use a cursor because of the reasons mentioned
    above, it will try the fallback cursor. Fallback cursors can themselves have
    fallback cursors again, so it is possible to provide a chain of progressively
    easier to support cursors. If none of the provided cursors can be supported,
    the default cursor will be the ultimate fallback.

    In the rare case that you need to influence which of the backends

    that you need to call this function before initializing GTK.
    
    ## Backend-specific code
    
    When writing backend-specific code that is supposed to work with
    multiple GDK backends, you have to consider both compile time and
    runtime. At compile time, use the `GDK_WINDOWING_X11`, `GDK_WINDOWING_WIN32`
    macros, etc. to find out which backends are present in the GDK library
    you are building your application against. At runtime, use type-check

    #ifdef GDK_WINDOWING_X11

/**
    [gdk.dmabuf_texture_builder.DmabufTextureBuilder] is a builder used to construct [gdk.texture.Texture]
    objects from DMA buffers.
    
    DMA buffers are commonly called **_dma-bufs_**.
    
    DMA buffers are a feature of the Linux kernel to enable efficient buffer and
    memory sharing between hardware such as codecs, GPUs, displays, cameras and the
    kernel drivers controlling them. For example, a decoder may want its output to
    be directly shared with the display server for rendering without a copy.
    
    Any device driver which participates in DMA buffer sharing, can do so as either
    the exporter or importer of buffers (or both).
    
    The memory that is shared via DMA buffers is usually stored in non-system memory
    (maybe in device's local memory or something else not directly accessible by the
    CPU), and accessing this memory from the CPU may have higher-than-usual overhead.
    
    In particular for graphics data, it is not uncommon that data consists of multiple
    separate blocks of memory, for example one block for each of the red, green and
    blue channels. These blocks are called **_planes_**. DMA buffers can have up to
    four planes. Even if the memory is a single block, the data can be organized in
    multiple planes, by specifying offsets from the beginning of the data.
    
    DMA buffers are exposed to user-space as file descriptors allowing to pass them
    between processes. If a DMA buffer has multiple planes, there is one file
    descriptor per plane.
    
    The format of the data (for graphics data, essentially its colorspace) is described
    by a 32-bit integer. These format identifiers are defined in the header file `drm_fourcc.h`
    and commonly referred to as **_fourcc_** values, since they are identified by 4 ASCII
    characters. Additionally, each DMA buffer has a **_modifier_**, which is a 64-bit integer
    that describes driver-specific details of the memory layout, such as tiling or compression.
    
    For historical reasons, some producers of dma-bufs don't provide an explicit modifier, but
    instead return `DMA_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` to indicate that their modifier is **_implicit_**.
    GTK tries to accommodate this situation by accepting `DMA_FORMAT_MOD_INVALID` as modifier.
    
    The operation of [gdk.dmabuf_texture_builder.DmabufTextureBuilder] is quite simple: Create a texture builder,
    set all the necessary properties, and then call [gdk.dmabuf_texture_builder.DmabufTextureBuilder.build]
    to create the new texture.
    
    The required properties for a dma-buf texture are
    
     $(LIST
        * The width and height in pixels
       
        * The `fourcc` code and `modifier` which identify the format and memory layout of the dma-buf
       
        * The file descriptor, offset and stride for each of the planes
     )
       
    [gdk.dmabuf_texture_builder.DmabufTextureBuilder] can be used for quick one-shot construction of
    textures as well as kept around and reused to construct multiple textures.

    A [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock] tells the application when to update and repaint
    a surface.
    
    This may be synced to the vertical refresh rate of the monitor, for example.
    Even when the frame clock uses a simple timer rather than a hardware-based
    vertical sync, the frame clock helps because it ensures everything paints at
    the same time (reducing the total number of frames).
    
    The frame clock can also automatically stop painting when it knows the frames
    will not be visible, or scale back animation framerates.
    
    [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock] is designed to be compatible with an OpenGL-based implementation
    or with mozRequestAnimationFrame in Firefox, for example.
    
    A frame clock is idle until someone requests a frame with
    [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.requestPhase]. At some later point that makes sense
    for the synchronization being implemented, the clock will process a frame and
    emit signals for each phase that has been requested. (See the signals of the
    [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock] class for documentation of the phases.
    [gdk.types.FrameClockPhase.Update] and the [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.update] signal
    are most interesting for application writers, and are used to update the
    animations, using the frame time given by [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.getFrameTime].
    
    The frame time is reported in microseconds and generally in the same
    timescale as [glib.global.getMonotonicTime], however, it is not the same
    as [glib.global.getMonotonicTime]. The frame time does not advance during
    the time a frame is being painted, and outside of a frame, an attempt
    is made so that all calls to [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.getFrameTime] that
    are called at a “similar” time get the same value. This means that
    if different animations are timed by looking at the difference in
    time between an initial value from [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.getFrameTime]
    and the value inside the [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.update] signal of the clock,

    [gdk.glcontext.GLContext]s are created for a surface using
    [gdk.surface.Surface.createGlContext], and the context will match
    the characteristics of the surface.
    
    A [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] is not tied to any particular normal framebuffer.
    For instance, it cannot draw to the surface back buffer. The GDK
    repaint system is in full control of the painting to that. Instead,
    you can create render buffers or textures and use `func@cairo_draw_from_gl`
    in the draw function of your widget to draw them. Then GDK will handle
    the integration of your rendering with that of other widgets.
    
    Support for [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] is platform-specific and context creation
    can fail, returning null context.
    
    A [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] has to be made "current" in order to start using
    it, otherwise any OpenGL call will be ignored.
    
    ## Creating a new OpenGL context
    
    In order to create a new [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] instance you need a [gdk.surface.Surface],
    which you typically get during the realize call of a widget.
    
    A [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] is not realized until either [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.makeCurrent]
    or [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.realize] is called. It is possible to specify
    details of the GL context like the OpenGL version to be used, or whether
    the GL context should have extra state validation enabled after calling
    [gdk.surface.Surface.createGlContext] by calling [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.realize].
    If the realization fails you have the option to change the settings of
    the [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] and try again.
    
    ## Using a GdkGLContext
    
    You will need to make the [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] the current context before issuing
    OpenGL calls; the system sends OpenGL commands to whichever context is current.
    It is possible to have multiple contexts, so you always need to ensure that
    the one which you want to draw with is the current one before issuing commands:
    
    ```c
    gdk_gl_context_make_current (context);
    ```
    
    You can now perform your drawing using OpenGL commands.
    
    You can check which [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] is the current one by using
    [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.getCurrent]; you can also unset any [gdk.glcontext.GLContext]
    that is currently set by calling [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.clearCurrent].

    [gdk.paintable.Paintable] is a simple interface used by GTK to represent content that
    can be painted.
    
    The content of a [gdk.paintable.Paintable] can be painted anywhere at any size
    without requiring any sort of layout. The interface is inspired by
    similar concepts elsewhere, such as
    [ClutterContent](https://developer.gnome.org/clutter/stable/ClutterContent.html),
    [HTML/CSS Paint Sources](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-images-4/#paint-source),
    or [SVG Paint Servers](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/pservers.html).
    
    A [gdk.paintable.Paintable] can be snapshot at any time and size using
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.snapshot]. How the paintable interprets that size and
    if it scales or centers itself into the given rectangle is implementation
    defined, though if you are implementing a [gdk.paintable.Paintable] and don't know what
    to do, it is suggested that you scale your paintable ignoring any potential
    aspect ratio.
    
    The contents that a [gdk.paintable.Paintable] produces may depend on the [gdk.snapshot.Snapshot]
    passed to it. For example, paintables may decide to use more detailed images
    on higher resolution screens or when OpenGL is available. A [gdk.paintable.Paintable]
    will however always produce the same output for the same snapshot.
    
    A [gdk.paintable.Paintable] may change its contents, meaning that it will now produce
    a different output with the same snapshot. Once that happens, it will call
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateContents] which will emit the
    `signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-contents` signal. If a paintable is known
    to never change its contents, it will set the [gdk.types.PaintableFlags.Contents]
    flag. If a consumer cannot deal with changing contents, it may call
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.getCurrentImage] which will return a static
    paintable and use that.
    
    A paintable can report an intrinsic (or preferred) size or aspect ratio it
    wishes to be rendered at, though it doesn't have to. Consumers of the interface
    can use this information to layout thepaintable appropriately. Just like the
    contents, the size of a paintable can change. A paintable will indicate this
    by calling [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateSize] which will emit the
    `signal@Gdk.Paintable::invalidate-size` signal. And just like for contents,
    if a paintable is known to never change its size, it will set the
    [gdk.types.PaintableFlags.Size] flag.
    
    Besides API for applications, there are some functions that are only
    useful for implementing subclasses and should not be used by applications:
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateContents],
    [gdk.paintable.Paintable.invalidateSize],

    anything about it other than increasing the reference count via
    [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.ref_], and consequently, it is a thread-safe object.
