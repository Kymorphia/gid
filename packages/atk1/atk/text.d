/**
    The ATK interface implemented by components with text content.
    
    #AtkText should be implemented by #AtkObjects on behalf of widgets
    that have text content which is either attributed or otherwise
    non-trivial.  #AtkObjects whose text content is simple,
    unattributed, and very brief may expose that content via
    #atk_object_get_name instead; however if the text is editable,
    multi-line, typically longer than three or four words, attributed,
    selectable, or if the object already uses the 'name' ATK property
    for other information, the #AtkText interface should be used to
    expose the text content.  In the case of editable text content,
    #AtkEditableText (a subtype of the #AtkText interface) should be
    implemented instead.
    
     #AtkText provides not only traversal facilities and change
    notification for text content, but also caret tracking and glyph
    bounding box calculations.  Note that the text strings are exposed
    as UTF-8, and are therefore potentially multi-byte, and
    caret-to-byte offset mapping makes no assumptions about the
    character length; also bounding box glyph-to-offset mapping may be
    complex for languages which use ligatures.
