 * within a single document.  A Hypertext instance is associated with
 * one or more Hyperlinks, which are associated with particular
 * offsets within the Hypertext's included content.  While this
 * interface is derived from Text, there is no requirement that
 * Hypertext instances have textual content; they may implement Image
 * as well, and Hyperlinks need not have non-zero text offsets.
