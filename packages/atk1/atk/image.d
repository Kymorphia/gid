/**
    The ATK Interface implemented by components
     which expose image or pixmap content on-screen.
    
    #AtkImage should be implemented by #AtkObject subtypes on behalf of
    components which display image/pixmap information onscreen, and
    which provide information (other than just widget borders, etc.)
    via that image content.  For instance, icons, buttons with icons,
    toolbar elements, and image viewing panes typically should
    implement #AtkImage.
    
    #AtkImage primarily provides two types of information: coordinate
    information (useful for screen review mode of screenreaders, and
    for use by onscreen magnifiers), and descriptive information.  The
    descriptive information is provided for alternative, text-only
    presentation of the most significant information present in the
    image.
