/**
    The ATK interface which represents the toplevel
     container for document content.
    
    The AtkDocument interface should be supported by any object whose
    content is a representation or view of a document.  The AtkDocument
    interface should appear on the toplevel container for the document
    content; however AtkDocument instances may be nested (i.e. an
    AtkDocument may be a descendant of another AtkDocument) in those
    cases where one document contains "embedded content" which can
    reasonably be considered a document in its own right.

      expected by ATK clients if and when AtkDocument implementors
      expose ATK_STATE_BUSY.  If the state of an AtkObject which
      implements AtkDocument does not include ATK_STATE_BUSY, it

      static contents are fully loaded into the container.

      interrupted by the user or application logic.  It should not
      however be emitted while waiting for a resource (for instance
      while blocking on a file or network read) unless a
      user-significant timeout has occurred.

      viewer.
  
      Params:

      document is refreshed from its source.  Once 'reload' has
      been emitted, a matching 'load-complete' or 'load-stopped'
      signal should follow, which clients may await before
      interrogating ATK for the latest document content.
