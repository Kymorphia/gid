/**
    Container for AtkPlug objects from other processes
    
    Together with #AtkPlug, #AtkSocket provides the ability to embed
    accessibles from one process into another in a fashion that is
    transparent to assistive technologies. #AtkSocket works as the
    container of #AtkPlug, embedding it using the method
    [atk.socket.Socket.embed]. Any accessible contained in the #AtkPlug will
    appear to the assistive technologies as being inside the
    application that created the #AtkSocket.
    
    The communication between a #AtkSocket and a #AtkPlug is done by
    the IPC layer of the accessibility framework, normally implemented
    by the D-Bus based implementation of AT-SPI (at-spi2). If that is
    the case, at-spi-atk2 is the responsible to implement the abstract
    methods [atk.plug.Plug.getId] and [atk.socket.Socket.embed], so an ATK
    implementor shouldn't reimplement them. The process that contains
    the #AtkPlug is responsible to send the ID returned by
    atk_plug_id() to the process that contains the #AtkSocket, so it
    could call the method [atk.socket.Socket.embed] in order to embed it.
    
    For the same reasons, an implementor doesn't need to implement
    [atk.object.ObjectWrap.getNAccessibleChildren] and
    [atk.object.ObjectWrap.refAccessibleChild]. All the logic related to those
    functions will be implemented by the IPC layer.
    
    See `class@AtkPlug`
