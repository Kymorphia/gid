/**
    The ATK interface provided by UI components
    which the user can activate/interact with.
    
    #AtkAction should be implemented by instances of #AtkObject classes
    with which the user can interact directly, i.e. buttons,
    checkboxes, scrollbars, e.g. components which are not "passive"
    providers of UI information.
    
    Exceptions: when the user interaction is already covered by another
    appropriate interface such as #AtkEditableText (insert/delete text,
    etc.) or #AtkValue (set value) then these actions should not be
    exposed by #AtkAction as well.
    
    Though most UI interactions on components should be invocable via
    keyboard as well as mouse, there will generally be a close mapping
    between "mouse actions" that are possible on a component and the
    AtkActions.  Where mouse and keyboard actions are redundant in
    effect, #AtkAction should expose only one action rather than
    exposing redundant actions if possible.  By convention we have been
    using "mouse centric" terminology for #AtkAction names.

          a button.
        * The sequence is the full list of keys which invoke the action even if the
          relevant element is not currently shown on screen. For instance, for a menu
          item the sequence is the keybindings used to open the parent menus before
          invoking. The sequence string is colon-delimited. Example: "Alt+F:N" in a
          traditional "New..." menu item.
        * The shortcut, if it exists, will invoke the same action without showing
          the component or its enclosing menus or dialogs. Example: "Ctrl+N" in a
          traditional "New..." menu item.

      for the German locale. If, hypothetically, this menu item lacked a mnemonic,
      it would be represented by ";;Ctrl+N" and ";;Strg+N" respectively.
