/**
    A function which is called when an object emits a matching event,
    as used in #atk_add_focus_tracker.
    Currently the only events for which object-specific handlers are
    supported are events of type "focus:".  Most clients of ATK will prefer to
    attach signal handlers for the various ATK signals instead.
    
    see `idatk_add_focus_tracker`

    Params:
      obj = An #AtkObject instance for whom the callback will be called when
        the specified event (e.g. 'focus:') takes place.

    An #AtkEventListenerInit function is a special function that is

    An #AtkKeySnoopFunc is a type of callback which is called whenever a key event occurs,

    Params:
      event = an AtkKeyEventStruct containing information about the key event for which
        notification is being given.
    Returns: TRUE (nonzero) if the event emission should be stopped and the event
      discarded without being passed to the normal GUI recipient; FALSE (zero) if the
      event dispatch to the client application should proceed as normal.
