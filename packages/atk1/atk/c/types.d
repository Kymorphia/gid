    Container for AtkPlug objects from other processes
    
    Together with #AtkPlug, #AtkSocket provides the ability to embed
    accessibles from one process into another in a fashion that is
    transparent to assistive technologies. #AtkSocket works as the
    container of #AtkPlug, embedding it using the method
    [atk.socket.Socket.embed]. Any accessible contained in the #AtkPlug will
    appear to the assistive technologies as being inside the
    application that created the #AtkSocket.
    
    The communication between a #AtkSocket and a #AtkPlug is done by
    the IPC layer of the accessibility framework, normally implemented
    by the D-Bus based implementation of AT-SPI (at-spi2). If that is
    the case, at-spi-atk2 is the responsible to implement the abstract
    methods [atk.plug.Plug.getId] and [atk.socket.Socket.embed], so an ATK
    implementor shouldn't reimplement them. The process that contains
    the #AtkPlug is responsible to send the ID returned by
    atk_plug_id() to the process that contains the #AtkSocket, so it
    could call the method [atk.socket.Socket.embed] in order to embed it.
    
    For the same reasons, an implementor doesn't need to implement
    [atk.object.ObjectWrap.getNAccessibleChildren] and
    [atk.object.ObjectWrap.refAccessibleChild]. All the logic related to those
    functions will be implemented by the IPC layer.

/**
    The ATK interface implemented for UI components which contain tabular or row/column information.
    
    #AtkTable should be implemented by components which present
    elements ordered via rows and columns.  It may also be used to
    present tree-structured information if the nodes of the trees can
    be said to contain multiple "columns".  Individual elements of an
    #AtkTable are typically referred to as "cells". Those cells should
    implement the interface #AtkTableCell, but #Atk doesn't require
    them to be direct children of the current #AtkTable. They can be
    grand-children, grand-grand-children etc. #AtkTable provides the
    API needed to get a individual cell based on the row and column
    numbers.
    
    Children of #AtkTable are frequently "lightweight" objects, that
    is, they may not have backing widgets in the host UI toolkit.  They
    are therefore often transient.
    
    Since tables are often very complex, #AtkTable includes provision
    for offering simplified summary information, as well as row and
    column headers and captions.  Headers and captions are #AtkObjects
    which may implement other interfaces (#AtkText, #AtkImage, etc.) as
    appropriate.  #AtkTable summaries may themselves be (simplified)
    #AtkTables, etc.
    
    Note for implementors: in the past, #AtkTable required that all the
    cells should be direct children of #AtkTable, and provided some
    index based methods to request the cells. The practice showed that
    that forcing made #AtkTable implementation complex, and hard to
    expose other kind of children, like rows or captions. Right now,
    index-based methods are deprecated.

    In addition to providing the current value, implementors can
    optionally provide an end-user-consumable textual description
    associated with this value. This description should be included
    when the numeric value fails to convey the full, on-screen
    representation seen by users.
    </para>
    
    <example>
    <title>Password strength</title>
    A password strength meter whose value changes as the user types
    their new password. Red is used for values less than 4.0, yellow
    for values between 4.0 and 7.0, and green for values greater than
    7.0. In this instance, value text should be provided by the
    implementor. Appropriate value text would be "weak", "acceptable,"
    and "strong" respectively.
    </example>
    
    A level bar whose value changes to reflect the battery charge. The
    color remains the same regardless of the charge and there is no
    on-screen text reflecting the fullness of the battery. In this
    case, because the position within the bar is the only indication
    the user has of the current charge, value text should not be
    provided by the implementor.
    
    <refsect2 id="implementor-notes">

    <para>
    Implementors should bear in mind that assistive technologies will
    likely prefer the value text provided over the numeric value when
    presenting a widget's value. As a result, strings not intended for
    end users should not be exposed in the value text, and strings
    which are exposed should be localized. In the case of widgets which
    display value text on screen, for instance through a separate label
    in close proximity to the value-displaying widget, it is still
    expected that implementors will expose the value text using the
    above API.
    </para>
    
    <para>
    #AtkValue should NOT be implemented for widgets whose displayed
    value is not reflective of a meaningful amount. For instance, a
    progress pulse indicator whose value alternates between 0.0 and 1.0
    to indicate that some process is still taking place should not
    implement #AtkValue because the current value does not reflect
    progress towards completion.
    </para>
    </refsect2>
    </refsect1>
    
    <refsect1 id="ranges">
    <title>On the subject of ranges</title>
    <para>
    In addition to providing the minimum and maximum values,
    implementors can optionally provide details about subranges
    associated with the widget. These details should be provided by the
    implementor when both of the following are communicated visually to
    the end user:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>The existence of distinct ranges such as "weak",
      "acceptable", and "strong" indicated by color, bar tick marks,
      and/or on-screen text.</listitem>
      <listitem>Where the current value stands within a given subrange,
      for instance illustrating progression from very "weak" towards
      nearly "acceptable" through changes in shade and/or position on
      the bar within the "weak" subrange.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
    If both of the above do not apply to the widget, it should be
    sufficient to expose the numeric value, along with the value text
    if appropriate, to make the widget accessible.
    </para>
    
    <refsect2 id="ranges-implementor-notes">
    <title>Implementor Notes</title>
    <para>
    If providing subrange details is deemed necessary, all possible
    values of the widget are expected to fall within one of the
    subranges defined by the implementor.
    </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect1 id="localization">
    <title>On the subject of localization of end-user-consumable text
    values</title>
    <para>
    Because value text and subrange descriptors are human-consumable,
    implementors are expected to provide localized strings which can be
    directly presented to end users via their assistive technology. In
    order to simplify this for implementors, implementors can use
    [atk.global.valueTypeGetLocalizedName] with the following
    already-localized constants for commonly-needed values can be used:

    Proposals for additional constants, along with their use cases,
    should be submitted to the GNOME Accessibility Team.
