/**
    The ATK interface provided by UI components
  which occupy a physical area on the screen.
  which the user can activate/interact with.
  
  #AtkComponent should be implemented by most if not all UI elements
  with an actual on-screen presence, i.e. components which can be
  said to have a screen-coordinate bounding box.  Virtually all
  widgets will need to have #AtkComponent implementations provided
  for their corresponding #AtkObject class.  In short, only UI
  elements which are *not* GUI elements will omit this ATK interface.
  
  A possible exception might be textual information with a
  transparent background, in which case text glyph bounding box
  information is provided by #AtkText.
