/**
 * The ATK interface provided by UI components
 * which the user can activate/interact with.
 * #AtkAction should be implemented by instances of #AtkObject classes
 * with which the user can interact directly, i.e. buttons,
 * checkboxes, scrollbars, e.g. components which are not "passive"
 * providers of UI information.
 * Exceptions: when the user interaction is already covered by another
 * appropriate interface such as #AtkEditableText $(LPAREN)insert/delete text,
 * etc.$(RPAREN) or #AtkValue $(LPAREN)set value$(RPAREN) then these actions should not be
 * exposed by #AtkAction as well.
 * Though most UI interactions on components should be invocable via
 * keyboard as well as mouse, there will generally be a close mapping
 * between "mouse actions" that are possible on a component and the
 * AtkActions.  Where mouse and keyboard actions are redundant in
 * effect, #AtkAction should expose only one action rather than
 * exposing redundant actions if possible.  By convention we have been
 * using "mouse centric" terminology for #AtkAction names.

   * be in the format "mnemonic;sequence;shortcut".
   * - The mnemonic key activates the object if it is presently enabled onscreen.
   * This typically corresponds to the underlined letter within the widget.
   * Example: "n" in a traditional "New..." menu item or the "a" in "Apply" for
   * a button.
   * - The sequence is the full list of keys which invoke the action even if the
   * relevant element is not currently shown on screen. For instance, for a menu
   * item the sequence is the keybindings used to open the parent menus before
   * invoking. The sequence string is colon-delimited. Example: "Alt+F:N" in a
   * traditional "New..." menu item.
   * - The shortcut, if it exists, will invoke the same action without showing
   * the component or its enclosing menus or dialogs. Example: "Ctrl+N" in a
   * traditional "New..." menu item.
   * Example: For a traditional "New..." menu item, the expected return value
   * would be: "N;Alt+F:N;Ctrl+N" for the English locale and "N;Alt+D:N;Strg+N"
   * for the German locale. If, hypothetically, this menu item lacked a mnemonic,
   * it would be represented by ";;Ctrl+N" and ";;Strg+N" respectively.
   * Params:

   * Returns: the keybinding which can be used to activate
   *   this action, or %NULL if there is no keybinding for this action.
