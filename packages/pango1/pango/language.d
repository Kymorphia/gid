      font feature requirements unique to the language. It is suitable for use
      as sample text in a font selection dialog.

      Determines the scripts used to to write language.
      
      If nothing is known about the language tag language,
      or if language is null, then null is returned.
      The list of scripts returned starts with the script that the
      language uses most and continues to the one it uses least.
      
      The value num_script points at will be set to the number
      of scripts in the returned array (or zero if null is returned).
      
      Most languages use only one script for writing, but there are
      some that use two (Latin and Cyrillic for example), and a few
      use three (Japanese for example). Applications should not make
      any assumptions on the maximum number of scripts returned
      though, except that it is positive if the return value is not
      null, and it is a small number.
      
      The [pango.language.Language.includesScript] function uses this
      function internally.
      
      Note: while the return value is declared as [pango.types.Script], the
      returned values are from the [glib.types.UnicodeScript] enumeration, which
      may have more values. Callers need to handle unknown values.
      Returns: An array of [pango.types.Script] values, with the number of entries in
          the array stored in num_scripts, or null if Pango does not have
          any information about this particular language tag (also the case

  /**
      Returns the [pango.language.Language] for the current locale of the process.
      
      On Unix systems, this is the return value is derived from
      `setlocale (LC_CTYPE, NULL)`, and the user can
      affect this through the environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or
      LANG (checked in that order). The locale string typically is in
      the form lang_COUNTRY, where lang is an ISO-639 language code, and
      COUNTRY is an ISO-3166 country code. For instance, sv_FI for
      Swedish as written in Finland or pt_BR for Portuguese as written in
      Brazil.
      
      On Windows, the C library does not use any such environment
      variables, and setting them won't affect the behavior of functions
      like ctime(). The user sets the locale through the Regional Options
      in the Control Panel. The C library (in the setlocale() function)
      does not use country and language codes, but country and language
      names spelled out in English.
      However, this function does check the above environment
      variables, and does return a Unix-style locale string based on
      either said environment variables or the thread's current locale.
      
      Your application should call `setlocale(LC_ALL, "")` for the user
      settings to take effect. GTK does this in its initialization
      functions automatically (by calling gtk_set_locale()).
      See the setlocale() manpage for more details.
      
      Note that the default language can change over the life of an application.
      
      Also note that this function will not do the right thing if you
      use per-thread locales with uselocale(). In that case, you should
      just call [pango.language.Language.fromString] yourself.
