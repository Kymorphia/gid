/**
    [gtk.builder_scope.BuilderScope] is an interface to provide language binding support
  to [gtk.builder.Builder].
  
  The goal of [gtk.builder_scope.BuilderScope] is to look up programming-language-specific
  values for strings that are given in a [gtk.builder.Builder] UI file.
  
  The primary intended audience is bindings that want to provide deeper
  integration of [gtk.builder.Builder] into the language.
  
  A [gtk.builder_scope.BuilderScope] instance may be used with multiple [gtk.builder.Builder] objects,
  even at once.
  
  By default, GTK will use its own implementation of [gtk.builder_scope.BuilderScope]
  for the C language which can be created via [gtk.builder_cscope.BuilderCScope.new_].
  
  If you implement [gtk.builder_scope.BuilderScope] for a language binding, you
  may want to (partially) derive from or fall back to a [gtk.builder_cscope.BuilderCScope],
  as that class implements support for automatic lookups from C symbols.
