/**
    [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel] is an interface that add support for selection to list models.
  
  This support is then used by widgets using list models to add the ability
  to select and unselect various items.
  
  GTK provides default implementations of the most common selection modes such
  as [gtk.single_selection.SingleSelection], so you will only need to implement this
  interface if you want detailed control about how selections should be handled.
  
  A [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel] supports a single boolean per item indicating if an item is
  selected or not. This can be queried via [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel.isSelected].
  When the selected state of one or more items changes, the model will emit the
  `signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal by calling the
  [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel.selectionChanged] function. The positions given
  in that signal may have their selection state changed, though that is not a
  requirement. If new items added to the model via the
  `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal are selected or not is up to the
  implementation.
  
  Note that items added via `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` may already
  be selected and no `signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed` will be
  emitted for them. So to track which items are selected, it is necessary to
  listen to both signals.
  
  Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect
  items. If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users
  to select and unselect items. However, [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel]s are free to only
  implement them partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not
  support the unimplemented operations.
  
  When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of
  the selection functions do *not* indicate if selection or unselection happened.
  They are only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of
  selecting is not supported by the model.
  
  Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out
  when an item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.
