/**
    The tree interface used by GtkTreeView
    
    The [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] interface defines a generic tree interface for
    use by the [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] widget. It is an abstract interface, and
    is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
    programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
    type for it to be viewable by a [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] widget.
    
    The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
    columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
    every node has different values depending on which column is being
    queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
    the GType system (ie. `G_TYPE_INT`, `GTK_TYPE_BUTTON`, `G_TYPE_POINTER`,
    etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
    important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
    a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
    model decides how and if changes are made.
    
    In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
    write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
    — the [gtk.tree_store.TreeStore] and the [gtk.list_store.ListStore]. To use these, the
    developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
    models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
    interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
    storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
    these two models are sufficient.
    
    Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
    query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
    column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
    particular node in a model. They are the [gtk.tree_path.TreePath] and
    the [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter] (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
    interface consists of operations on a [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter].
    
    A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
    that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
    model. A [gtk.tree_path.TreePath] can be converted into either an
    array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
    of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
    at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
    node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
    the third node.
    
    By contrast, a [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter] is a reference to a specific node on
    a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
    generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
    way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
    [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.getIter]. These iterators are the primary way
    of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
    [gtk.text_buffer.TextBuffer]. They are generally statically allocated on the
    stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
    a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
    
    It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
    For example, the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] model, which is internally a simple
    linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
    [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]Sort stores an array and an offset in two of the
    pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
    generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
    catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
    
    The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
    Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
    is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
    to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
    free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
    guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
    to is valid (most notably the [gtk.tree_store.TreeStore] and [gtk.list_store.ListStore]).
    Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
    the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
    important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
    As a result, the [gtk.types.TreeModelFlags.ItersPersist] flag was added to
    indicate this behavior.
    
    To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
    provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
    the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
    easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
    callbacks.
    
    ## Acquiring a [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter]
    
    ```c
    // Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
    GtkTreePath *path;
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    GtkTreeIter parent_iter;
    
    // get the iterator from a string
    gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
                                         &iter,
                                         "3:2:5");
    
    // get the iterator from a path
    path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
    gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
    gtk_tree_path_free (path);
    
    // walk the tree to find the iterator
    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                   NULL, 3);
    parent_iter = iter;
    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                   &parent_iter, 2);
    parent_iter = iter;
    gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                   &parent_iter, 5);
    ```
    
    This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
    and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
    populate_model() function used below is not
    shown, as it is specific to the [gtk.list_store.ListStore]. For information on
    how to write such a function, see the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] documentation.
    
    ## Reading data from a [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]
    
    ```c
    enum
    {
      STRING_COLUMN,
      INT_COLUMN,
      N_COLUMNS
    };
    
    ...
    
    GtkTreeModel *list_store;
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    gboolean valid;
    int row_count = 0;
    
    // make a new list_store
    list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                     G_TYPE_STRING,
                                     G_TYPE_INT);
    
    // Fill the list store with data
    populate_model (list_store);
    
    // Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
    // through the list, reading each row.
    
    valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
                                           &iter);
    while (valid)
     {
       char *str_data;
       int    int_data;
    
       // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
       gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
                           STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
                           INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
                           -1);
    
       // Do something with the data
       g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
                row_count, str_data, int_data);
       g_free (str_data);
    
       valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
                                         &iter);
       row_count++;
     }
    ```
    
    The [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] interface contains two methods for reference
    counting: [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.refNode] and [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.unrefNode].
    These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
    is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
    displayed. [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] will take a reference on a node when it is
    visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
    Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
    visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
    scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
    a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
    not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
    folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
    
    When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
    into account:
    
    $(LIST
      * Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
        This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
        as well.
      
      * Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
        possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
        row-deleted signal is received.
      
      * Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
        siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
        required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
        however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
        is always referenced when any view is attached).
