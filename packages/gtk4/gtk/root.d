/**
    [gtk.root.Root] is the interface implemented by all widgets that can act as a toplevel
  widget.
  
  The root widget takes care of providing the connection to the windowing system
  and manages layout, drawing and event delivery for its widget hierarchy.
  
  The obvious example of a [gtk.root.Root] is [gtk.window.Window].
  
  To get the display to which a [gtk.root.Root] belongs, use
  [gtk.root.Root.getDisplay].
  
  [gtk.root.Root] also maintains the location of keyboard focus inside its widget
  hierarchy, with [gtk.root.Root.setFocus] and [gtk.root.Root.getFocus].
