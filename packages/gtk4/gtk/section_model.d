/**
    [gtk.section_model.SectionModel] is an interface that adds support for sections to list models.
  
  A [gtk.section_model.SectionModel] groups successive items into so-called sections. List widgets
  like [gtk.list_view.ListView] and [gtk.grid_view.GridView] then allow displaying section headers for
  these sections by installing a header factory.
  
  Many GTK list models support sections inherently, or they pass through the sections
  of a model they are wrapping.
  
  When the section groupings of a model change, the model will emit the
  `signal@Gtk.SectionModel::sections-changed` signal by calling the
  [gtk.section_model.SectionModel.sectionsChanged] function. All sections in the given range
  then need to be queried again.
  The `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal has the same effect, all sections in
  that range are invalidated, too.

      Emitted when the start-of-section state of some of the items in model changes.
    
    Note that this signal does not specify the new section state of the
    items, they need to be queried manually. It is also not necessary for
    a model to change the section state of any of the items in the section
    model, though it would be rather useless to emit such a signal.
    
    The `signalGio.ListModel::items-changed` implies the effect of the
    `signalGtk.SectionModel::sections-changed` signal for all the items
    it covers.

      * $(B position)       The first item that may have changed
      * $(B nItems)       number of items with changes
      * $(B sectionModel) the instance the signal is connected to
