/**
    [gtk.editable.Editable] is an interface for text editing widgets.
    
    Typical examples of editable widgets are [gtk.entry.Entry] and
    [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton]. It contains functions for generically manipulating
    an editable widget, a large number of action signals used for key bindings,
    and several signals that an application can connect to modify the behavior
    of a widget.
    
    As an example of the latter usage, by connecting the following handler to
    `signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text`, an application can convert all entry
    into a widget into uppercase.
    
    ## Forcing entry to uppercase.
    
    ```c
    #include <ctype.h>
    
    void
    insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
                         const char  *text,
                         int          length,
                         int         *position,
                         gpointer     data)
    {
      char *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);
    
      g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
                                   (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
      gtk_editable_insert_text (editable, result, length, position);
      g_signal_handlers_unblock_by_func (editable,
                                         (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
    
      g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (editable, "insert_text");
    
      g_free (result);
    }
    ```
    
    ## Implementing GtkEditable
    
    The most likely scenario for implementing [gtk.editable.Editable] on your own widget
    is that you will embed a [gtk.text.Text] inside a complex widget, and want to
    delegate the editable functionality to that text widget. [gtk.editable.Editable]
    provides some utility functions to make this easy.
    
    In your class_init function, call [gtk.editable.Editable.installProperties],
    passing the first available property ID:
    
    ```c
    static void
    my_class_init (MyClass *class)
    {
      ...
      g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, NUM_PROPERTIES, props);
      gtk_editable_install_properties (object_clas, NUM_PROPERTIES);
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    In your interface_init function for the [gtk.editable.Editable] interface, provide
    an implementation for the get_delegate vfunc that returns your text widget:
    
    ```c
    GtkEditable *
    get_editable_delegate (GtkEditable *editable)
    {
      return GTK_EDITABLE (MY_WIDGET (editable)->text_widget);
    }
    
    static void
    my_editable_init (GtkEditableInterface *iface)
    {
      iface->get_delegate = get_editable_delegate;
    }
    ```
    
    You don't need to provide any other vfuncs. The default implementations
    work by forwarding to the delegate that the GtkEditableInterface.get_delegate()
    vfunc returns.
    
    In your instance_init function, create your text widget, and then call
    [gtk.editable.Editable.initDelegate]:
    
    ```c
    static void
    my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
    {
      ...
      self->text_widget = gtk_text_new ();
      gtk_editable_init_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    In your dispose function, call [gtk.editable.Editable.finishDelegate] before
    destroying your text widget:
    
    ```c
    static void
    my_widget_dispose (GObject *object)
    {
      ...
      gtk_editable_finish_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
      g_clear_pointer (&self->text_widget, gtk_widget_unparent);
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    Finally, use [gtk.editable.Editable.delegateSetProperty] in your `set_property`
    function (and similar for `get_property`), to set the editable properties:
    
    ```c
      ...
      if (gtk_editable_delegate_set_property (object, prop_id, value, pspec))
        return;
    
      switch (prop_id)
      ...
    ```
    
    It is important to note that if you create a [gtk.editable.Editable] that uses
    a delegate, the low level `signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text` and
    `signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text` signals will be propagated from the
    "wrapper" editable to the delegate, but they will not be propagated from
    the delegate to the "wrapper" editable, as they would cause an infinite
    recursion. If you wish to connect to the `signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text`
    and `signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text` signals, you will need to connect
    to them on the delegate obtained via [gtk.editable.Editable.getDelegate].
