/**
    [gtk.scrollable.Scrollable] is an interface for widgets with native scrolling ability.
    
    To implement this interface you should override the
    [gtk.scrollable.Scrollable.hadjustment] and
    [gtk.scrollable.Scrollable.vadjustment] properties.
    
    ## Creating a scrollable widget
    
    All scrollable widgets should do the following.
    
    $(LIST
      * When a parent widget sets the scrollable child widget’s adjustments,
        the widget should connect to the `signal@Gtk.Adjustment::value-changed`
        signal. The child widget should then populate the adjustments’ properties
        as soon as possible, which usually means queueing an allocation right away
        and populating the properties in the `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.size_allocate`
        implementation.
      
      * Because its preferred size is the size for a fully expanded widget,
        the scrollable widget must be able to cope with underallocations.
        This means that it must accept any value passed to its
        `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.size_allocate` implementation.
      
      * When the parent allocates space to the scrollable child widget,
        the widget must ensure the adjustments’ property values are correct and up
        to date, for example using [gtk.adjustment.Adjustment.configure].
      
      * When any of the adjustments emits the `signal@Gtk.Adjustment::value-changed`
        signal, the scrollable widget should scroll its contents.
