    The [gtk.about_dialog.AboutDialog] offers a simple way to display information about
  a program.
  
  The shown information includes the programs' logo, name, copyright,
  website and license. It is also possible to give credits to the authors,
  documenters, translators and artists who have worked on the program.
  
  An about dialog is typically opened when the user selects the `About`
  option from the `Help` menu. All parts of the dialog are optional.
  
  ![An example GtkAboutDialog](aboutdialog.png)
  
  About dialogs often contain links and email addresses. [gtk.about_dialog.AboutDialog]
  displays these as clickable links. By default, it calls [gtk.file_launcher.FileLauncher.launch]
  when a user clicks one. The behaviour can be overridden with the
  `signal@Gtk.AboutDialog::activate-link` signal.
  
  To specify a person with an email address, use a string like
  `Edgar Allan Poe <edgar@poe.com>`. To specify a website with a title,
  use a string like `GTK team https://www.gtk.org`.
  
  To make constructing a [gtk.about_dialog.AboutDialog] as convenient as possible, you can
  use the function `func@Gtk.show_about_dialog` which constructs and shows
  a dialog and keeps it around so that it can be shown again.
  
  Note that GTK sets a default title of `_("About `s`")` on the dialog
  window (where ``s`` is replaced by the name of the application, but in
  order to ensure proper translation of the title, applications should
  set the title property explicitly when constructing a [gtk.about_dialog.AboutDialog],
  as shown in the following example:
  
  ```c
  GFile *logo_file = g_file_new_for_path ("./logo.png");
  GdkTexture *example_logo = gdk_texture_new_from_file (logo_file, NULL);
  g_object_unref (logo_file);
  
  gtk_show_about_dialog (NULL,
                         "program-name", "ExampleCode",
                         "logo", example_logo,
                         "title", _("About ExampleCode"),
                         NULL);

    [gtk.accessible.Accessible] is an interface for describing UI elements for
  Assistive Technologies.
  
  Every accessible implementation has:
  
   $(LIST
      * a “role”, represented by a value of the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole] enumeration
      * an “attribute”, represented by a set of [gtk.types.AccessibleState],
        [gtk.types.AccessibleProperty] and [gtk.types.AccessibleRelation] values
   )
     
  The role cannot be changed after instantiating a [gtk.accessible.Accessible]
  implementation.
  
  The attributes are updated every time a UI element's state changes in
  a way that should be reflected by assistive technologies. For instance,
  if a [gtk.widget.Widget] visibility changes, the [gtk.types.AccessibleState.Hidden]
  state will also change to reflect the [gtk.widget.Widget.gboolean] property.
  
  Every accessible implementation is part of a tree of accessible objects.
  Normally, this tree corresponds to the widget tree, but can be customized
  by reimplementing the `vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_accessible_parent`,
  `vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_first_accessible_child` and
  `vfunc@Gtk.Accessible.get_next_accessible_sibling` virtual functions.
  Note that you can not create a top-level accessible object as of now,
  which means that you must always have a parent accessible object.
  Also note that when an accessible object does not correspond to a widget,
  and it has children, whose implementation you don't control,
  it is necessary to ensure the correct shape of the a11y tree
  by calling [gtk.accessible.Accessible.setAccessibleParent] and

      implemented according to the design of each platform and/or
      application requiring them.

/**
    [gtk.application.Application] is a high-level API for writing applications.
  
  It supports many aspects of writing a GTK application in a convenient
  fashion, without enforcing a one-size-fits-all model.
  
  Currently, [gtk.application.Application] handles GTK initialization, application
  uniqueness, session management, provides some basic scriptability and
  desktop shell integration by exporting actions and menus and manages a
  list of toplevel windows whose life-cycle is automatically tied to the
  life-cycle of your application.
  
  While [gtk.application.Application] works fine with plain [gtk.window.Window]s, it is
  recommended to use it together with [gtk.application_window.ApplicationWindow].
  
  ## Automatic resources
  
  [gtk.application.Application] will automatically load menus from the [gtk.builder.Builder]
  resource located at "gtk/menus.ui", relative to the application's
  resource base path (see [gio.application.Application.setResourceBasePath]).
  The menu with the ID "menubar" is taken as the application's
  menubar. Additional menus (most interesting submenus) can be named
  and accessed via [gtk.application.Application.getMenuById] which allows for
  dynamic population of a part of the menu structure.
  
  Note that automatic resource loading uses the resource base path
  that is set at construction time and will not work if the resource
  base path is changed at a later time.
  
  It is also possible to provide the menubar manually using
  [gtk.application.Application.setMenubar].
  
  [gtk.application.Application] will also automatically setup an icon search path for
  the default icon theme by appending "icons" to the resource base
  path. This allows your application to easily store its icons as
  resources. See [gtk.icon_theme.IconTheme.addResourcePath] for more
  information.
  
  If there is a resource located at `gtk/help-overlay.ui` which
  defines a [gtk.shortcuts_window.ShortcutsWindow] with ID `help_overlay` then
  [gtk.application.Application] associates an instance of this shortcuts window with
  each [gtk.application_window.ApplicationWindow] and sets up the keyboard accelerator
  <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>?</kbd> to open it. To create a menu item that
  displays the shortcuts window, associate the item with the action
  `win.show-help-overlay`.
  
  ## A simple application
  
  [A simple example](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/tree/main/examples/bp/bloatpad.c)
  is available in the GTK source code repository
  
  [gtk.application.Application] optionally registers with a session manager of the
  users session (if you set the `property@Gtk.Application:register-session`
  property) and offers various functionality related to the session
  life-cycle.
  
  An application can block various ways to end the session with
  the [gtk.application.Application.inhibit] function. Typical use cases for
  this kind of inhibiting are long-running, uninterruptible operations,
  such as burning a CD or performing a disk backup. The session
  manager may not honor the inhibitor, but it can be expected to
  inform the user about the negative consequences of ending the
  session while inhibitors are present.

    [gtk.application_window.ApplicationWindow] is a [gtk.window.Window] subclass that integrates with
  [gtk.application.Application].
  
  Notably, [gtk.application_window.ApplicationWindow] can handle an application menubar.
  
  This class implements the [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] and [gio.action_map.ActionMap] interfaces,
  to let you add window-specific actions that will be exported by the
  associated [gtk.application.Application], together with its application-wide
  actions. Window-specific actions are prefixed with the “win.”
  prefix and application-wide actions are prefixed with the “app.”
  prefix. Actions must be addressed with the prefixed name when
  referring to them from a [gio.menu_model.MenuModel].
  
  Note that widgets that are placed inside a [gtk.application_window.ApplicationWindow]
  can also activate these actions, if they implement the
  [gtk.actionable.Actionable] interface.
  
  The settings `property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-shell-shows-app-menu` and
  `property@Gtk.Settings:gtk-shell-shows-menubar` tell GTK whether the
  desktop environment is showing the application menu and menubar
  models outside the application as part of the desktop shell.
  For instance, on OS X, both menus will be displayed remotely;
  on Windows neither will be.
  
  If the desktop environment does not display the menubar, then
  [gtk.application_window.ApplicationWindow] will automatically show a menubar for it.
  This behaviour can be overridden with the
  `property@Gtk.ApplicationWindow:show-menubar` property. If the
  desktop environment does not display the application menu, then
  it will automatically be included in the menubar or in the windows
  client-side decorations.
  
  See [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] for information about the XML language
  used by [gtk.builder.Builder] for menu models.

    A [gtk.builder.Builder] reads XML descriptions of a user interface and

  To create a [gtk.builder.Builder] from a user interface description, call
  [gtk.builder.Builder.newFromFile], [gtk.builder.Builder.newFromResource]
  or [gtk.builder.Builder.newFromString].
  
  In the (unusual) case that you want to add user interface
  descriptions from multiple sources to the same [gtk.builder.Builder] you can
  call [gtk.builder.Builder.new_] to get an empty builder and populate it by
  (multiple) calls to [gtk.builder.Builder.addFromFile],
  [gtk.builder.Builder.addFromResource] or
  [gtk.builder.Builder.addFromString].
  
  A [gtk.builder.Builder] holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed
  and drops these references when it is finalized. This finalization can
  cause the destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not
  contained in a toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a
  builder, it is the responsibility of the user to call
  [gtk.window.Window.destroy] to get rid of them and all the widgets
  they contain.
  
  The functions [gtk.builder.Builder.getObject] and
  [gtk.builder.Builder.getObjects] can be used to access the widgets in
  the interface by the names assigned to them inside the UI description.
  Toplevel windows returned by these functions will stay around until the
  user explicitly destroys them with [gtk.window.Window.destroy]. Other
  widgets will either be part of a larger hierarchy constructed by the
  builder (in which case you should not have to worry about their lifecycle),
  or without a parent, in which case they have to be added to some container
  to make use of them. Non-widget objects need to be reffed with
  [gobject.object.ObjectG.ref_] to keep them beyond the lifespan of the builder.
  
  ## GtkBuilder UI Definitions
  
  [gtk.builder.Builder] parses textual descriptions of user interfaces which are
  specified in XML format. We refer to these descriptions as “GtkBuilder
  UI definitions” or just “UI definitions” if the context is clear.
  
  ### Structure of UI definitions
  
  UI definition files are always encoded in UTF-8.
  
  The toplevel element is `<interface>`. It optionally takes a “domain”
  attribute, which will make the builder look for translated strings
  using `dgettext()` in the domain specified. This can also be done by
  calling [gtk.builder.Builder.setTranslationDomain] on the builder.
  For example:
  
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
  <interface domain="your-app">
    ...
  </interface>
  ```
  
  ### Requirements
  
  The target toolkit version(s) are described by `<requires>` elements,
  the “lib” attribute specifies the widget library in question (currently
  the only supported value is “gtk”) and the “version” attribute specifies
  the target version in the form “`<major>`.`<minor>`”. [gtk.builder.Builder] will
  error out if the version requirements are not met. For example:
  
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
  <interface domain="your-app">
    <requires lib="gtk" version="4.0" />
  </interface>
  ```
  
  ### Objects
  
  Objects are defined as children of the `<interface>` element.
  
  Objects are described by `<object>` elements, which can contain
  `<property>` elements to set properties, `<signal>` elements which
  connect signals to handlers, and `<child>` elements, which describe
  child objects.
  
  Typically, the specific kind of object represented by an `<object>`
  element is specified by the “class” attribute. If the type has not
  been loaded yet, GTK tries to find the `get_type()` function from the
  class name by applying heuristics. This works in most cases, but if
  necessary, it is possible to specify the name of the `get_type()`
  function explicitly with the "type-func" attribute. If your UI definition
  is referencing internal types, you should make sure to call
  `[gobject.global.typeEnsure]` for each object type before parsing the UI definition.
  
  Objects may be given a name with the “id” attribute, which allows the
  application to retrieve them from the builder with
  [gtk.builder.Builder.getObject]. An id is also necessary to use the
  object as property value in other parts of the UI definition. GTK
  reserves ids starting and ending with `___` (three consecutive
  underscores) for its own purposes.
  
  ### Properties
  
  Setting properties of objects is pretty straightforward with the
  `<property>` element: the “name” attribute specifies the name of the
  property, and the content of the element specifies the value:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkButton">
    <property name="label">Hello, world</property>
  </object>
  ```
  
  If the “translatable” attribute is set to a true value, GTK uses
  `gettext()` (or `dgettext()` if the builder has a translation domain set)
  to find a translation for the value. This happens before the value
  is parsed, so it can be used for properties of any type, but it is
  probably most useful for string properties. It is also possible to
  specify a context to disambiguate short strings, and comments which
  may help the translators:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkButton">
    <property name="label" translatable="yes" context="button">Hello, world</property>
  </object>
  ```
  
  [gtk.builder.Builder] can parse textual representations for the most common
  property types:
  
  $(LIST
    * characters
    * strings
    * integers
    * floating-point numbers
    * booleans (strings like “TRUE”, “t”, “yes”, “y”, “1” are interpreted
      as true values, strings like “FALSE”, “f”, “no”, “n”, “0” are interpreted
      as false values)
    * enumeration types (can be specified by their full C identifier their short
      name used when registering the enumeration type, or their integer value)
    * flag types (can be specified by their C identifier, short name, integer
      value, and optionally combined with “|” for bitwise OR, e.g.
      “GTK_INPUT_HINT_EMOJI|GTK_INPUT_HINT_LOWERCASE”, or “emoji|lowercase”)
    * colors (in a format understood by [gdk.rgba.RGBA.parse])
    * [glib.variant.VariantG] (can be specified in the format understood by
       [glib.variant.VariantG.parse])
    * pixbufs (can be specified as a filename of an image file to load)
  )
    
  Objects can be referred to by their name and by default refer to
  objects declared in the local XML fragment and objects exposed via
  [gtk.builder.Builder.exposeObject]. In general, [gtk.builder.Builder] allows
  forward references to objects declared in the local XML; an object
  doesn’t have to be constructed before it can be referred to. The
  exception to this rule is that an object has to be constructed before
  it can be used as the value of a construct-only property.
  
  ### Child objects
  
  Many widgets have properties for child widgets, such as
  [gtk.expander.Expander.Widget]. In this case, the preferred way to
  specify the child widget in a ui file is to simply set the property:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkExpander">
    <property name="child">
      <object class="GtkLabel">
      ...
      </object>
    </property>
  </object>
  ```
  
  Generic containers that can contain an arbitrary number of children,
  such as [gtk.box.Box] instead use the `<child>` element. A `<child>`
  element contains an `<object>` element which describes the child object.
  Most often, child objects are widgets inside a container, but they can
  also be, e.g., actions in an action group, or columns in a tree model.
  
  Any object type that implements the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface can
  specify how children may be added to it. Since many objects and widgets that
  are included with GTK already implement the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface,
  typically child objects can be added using the `<child>` element without
  having to be concerned about the underlying implementation.
  
  See the [[gtk.widget.Widget] documentation](class.Widget.html#gtkwidget-as-gtkbuildable)
  for many examples of using [gtk.builder.Builder] with widgets, including setting
  child objects using the `<child>` element.
  
  A noteworthy special case to the general rule that only objects implementing
  [gtk.buildable.Buildable] may specify how to handle the `<child>` element is that
  [gtk.builder.Builder] provides special support for adding objects to a
  [gio.list_store.ListStore] by using the `<child>` element. For instance:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GListStore">
    <property name="item-type">MyObject</property>
    <child>
      <object class="MyObject" />
    </child>
    ...
  </object>
  ```
  
  ### Property bindings
  
  It is also possible to bind a property value to another object's
  property value using the attributes "bind-source" to specify the
  source object of the binding, and optionally, "bind-property" and
  "bind-flags" to specify the source property and source binding flags
  respectively. Internally, [gtk.builder.Builder] implements this using
  [gobject.binding.Binding] objects.
  
  For instance, in the example below the “label” property of the
  `bottom_label` widget is bound to the “label” property of the
  `top_button` widget:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkBox">
    <property name="orientation">vertical</property>
    <child>
      <object class="GtkButton" id="top_button">
        <property name="label">Hello, world</property>
      </object>
    </child>
    <child>
      <object class="GtkLabel" id="bottom_label">
        <property name="label"
                  bind-source="top_button"
                  bind-property="label"
                  bind-flags="sync-create" />
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
  ```
  
  For more information, see the documentation of the
  [gobject.object.ObjectG.bindProperty] method.
  
  Please note that another way to set up bindings between objects in .ui files
  is to use the [gtk.expression.Expression] methodology. See the
  [[gtk.expression.Expression] documentation](class.Expression.html#gtkexpression-in-ui-files)
  for more information.
  
  ### Internal children
  
  Sometimes it is necessary to refer to widgets which have implicitly
  been constructed by GTK as part of a composite widget, to set
  properties on them or to add further children (e.g. the content area
  of a [gtk.dialog.Dialog]). This can be achieved by setting the “internal-child”
  property of the `<child>` element to a true value. Note that [gtk.builder.Builder]
  still requires an `<object>` element for the internal child, even if it
  has already been constructed.
  
  ### Specialized children
  
  A number of widgets have different places where a child can be added
  (e.g. tabs vs. page content in notebooks). This can be reflected in
  a UI definition by specifying the “type” attribute on a `<child>`
  The possible values for the “type” attribute are described in the
  sections describing the widget-specific portions of UI definitions.
  
  ### Signal handlers and function pointers
  
  Signal handlers are set up with the `<signal>` element. The “name”
  attribute specifies the name of the signal, and the “handler” attribute
  specifies the function to connect to the signal.
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
    <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button__clicked" />
  </object>
  ```
  
  The remaining attributes, “after”, “swapped” and “object”, have the
  same meaning as the corresponding parameters of the
  `func@GObject.signal_connect_object` or `func@GObject.signal_connect_data`
  functions:
  
  $(LIST
    * “after” matches the `G_CONNECT_AFTER` flag, and will ensure that the
      handler is called after the default class closure for the signal
    * “swapped” matches the `G_CONNECT_SWAPPED` flag, and will swap the
      instance and closure arguments when invoking the signal handler
    * “object” will bind the signal handler to the lifetime of the object
      referenced by the attribute
  )
    
  By default "swapped" will be set to "yes" if not specified otherwise, in
  the case where "object" is set, for convenience. A “last_modification_time”
  attribute is also allowed, but it does not have a meaning to the builder.
  
  When compiling applications for Windows, you must declare signal callbacks
  with the `G_MODULE_EXPORT` decorator, or they will not be put in the symbol
  table:
  
  ```c
  G_MODULE_EXPORT void
  hello_button__clicked (GtkButton *button,
                         gpointer data)
  {
    // ...
  }
  ```
  
  On Linux and Unix, this is not necessary; applications should instead
  be compiled with the `-Wl,--export-dynamic` argument inside their compiler
  flags, and linked against `gmodule-export-2.0`.
  
  ## Example UI Definition
  
  ```xml
  <interface>
    <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
      <child internal-child="content_area">
        <object class="GtkBox">
          <child internal-child="action_area">
            <object class="GtkBox">
              <child>
                <object class="GtkButton" id="ok_button">
                  <property name="label" translatable="yes">_Ok</property>
                  <property name="use-underline">True</property>
                  <signal name="clicked" handler="ok_button_clicked"/>
                </object>
              </child>
            </object>
          </child>
        </object>
      </child>
    </object>
  </interface>
  ```
  
  ## Using GtkBuildable for extending UI definitions
  
  Objects can implement the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface to add custom
  elements and attributes to the XML. Typically, any extension will be
  documented in each type that implements the interface.
  
  ## Templates
  
  When describing a [gtk.widget.Widget], you can use the `<template>` tag to
  describe a UI bound to a specific widget type. GTK will automatically load
  the UI definition when instantiating the type, and bind children and
  signal handlers to instance fields and function symbols.
  
  For more information, see the [[gtk.widget.Widget] documentation](class.Widget.html#building-composite-widgets-from-template-xml)
  for details.

    An abstract class for laying out [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]s
  
  The [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] is an abstract class for [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout]
  widgets (also referred to as "layouting widgets") to interface with
  an arbitrary number of [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]s and interact with the user
  for a given [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] row.
  
  The cell area handles events, focus navigation, drawing and
  size requests and allocations for a given row of data.
  
  Usually users dont have to interact with the [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] directly
  unless they are implementing a cell-layouting widget themselves.
  
  ## Requesting area sizes
  
  As outlined in
  [GtkWidget’s geometry management section](class.Widget.html#height-for-width-geometry-management),
  GTK uses a height-for-width
  geometry management system to compute the sizes of widgets and user
  interfaces. [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] uses the same semantics to calculate the
  size of an area for an arbitrary number of [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] rows.
  
  When requesting the size of a cell area one needs to calculate
  the size for a handful of rows, and this will be done differently by
  different layouting widgets. For instance a [gtk.tree_view_column.TreeViewColumn]
  always lines up the areas from top to bottom while a [gtk.icon_view.IconView]
  on the other hand might enforce that all areas received the same
  width and wrap the areas around, requesting height for more cell
  areas when allocated less width.
  
  It’s also important for areas to maintain some cell
  alignments with areas rendered for adjacent rows (cells can
  appear “columnized” inside an area even when the size of
  cells are different in each row). For this reason the [gtk.cell_area.CellArea]
  uses a [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] object to store the alignments
  and sizes along the way (as well as the overall largest minimum
  and natural size for all the rows which have been calculated
  with the said context).
  
  The [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] is an opaque object specific to the
  [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] which created it (see [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.createContext]).
  
  The owning cell-layouting widget can create as many contexts as
  it wishes to calculate sizes of rows which should receive the
  same size in at least one orientation (horizontally or vertically),
  However, it’s important that the same [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] which
  was used to request the sizes for a given [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] row be
  used when rendering or processing events for that row.
  
  In order to request the width of all the rows at the root level
  of a [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] one would do the following:
  
  ```c
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  int minimum_width;
  int natural_width;
  
  valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
  while (valid)
    {
      gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
      gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_width (area, context, widget, NULL, NULL);
  
      valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
    }
  
  gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (context, &minimum_width, &natural_width);
  ```
  
  Note that in this example it’s not important to observe the
  returned minimum and natural width of the area for each row
  unless the cell-layouting object is actually interested in the
  widths of individual rows. The overall width is however stored
  in the accompanying [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] object and can be consulted
  at any time.
  
  This can be useful since [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] widgets usually have to
  support requesting and rendering rows in treemodels with an
  exceedingly large amount of rows. The [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] widget in
  that case would calculate the required width of the rows in an
  idle or timeout source (see `func@GLib.timeout_add`) and when the widget
  is requested its actual width in `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure`
  it can simply consult the width accumulated so far in the
  [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] object.
  
  A simple example where rows are rendered from top to bottom and
  take up the full width of the layouting widget would look like:
  
  ```c
  static void
  foo_get_preferred_width (GtkWidget *widget,
                           int       *minimum_size,
                           int       *natural_size)
  {
    Foo *self = FOO (widget);
    FooPrivate *priv = foo_get_instance_private (self);
  
    foo_ensure_at_least_one_handfull_of_rows_have_been_requested (self);
  
    gtk_cell_area_context_get_preferred_width (priv->context, minimum_size, natural_size);
  }
  ```
  
  In the above example the `Foo` widget has to make sure that some
  row sizes have been calculated (the amount of rows that `Foo` judged
  was appropriate to request space for in a single timeout iteration)
  before simply returning the amount of space required by the area via
  the [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext].
  
  Requesting the height for width (or width for height) of an area is
  a similar task except in this case the [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] does not
  store the data (actually, it does not know how much space the layouting
  widget plans to allocate it for every row. It’s up to the layouting
  widget to render each row of data with the appropriate height and
  width which was requested by the [gtk.cell_area.CellArea]).
  
  In order to request the height for width of all the rows at the
  root level of a [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] one would do the following:
  
  ```c
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  int minimum_height;
  int natural_height;
  int full_minimum_height = 0;
  int full_natural_height = 0;
  
  valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
  while (valid)
    {
      gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
      gtk_cell_area_get_preferred_height_for_width (area, context, widget,
                                                    width, &minimum_height, &natural_height);
  
      if (width_is_for_allocation)
         cache_row_height (&iter, minimum_height, natural_height);
  
      full_minimum_height += minimum_height;
      full_natural_height += natural_height;
  
      valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
    }
  ```
  
  Note that in the above example we would need to cache the heights
  returned for each row so that we would know what sizes to render the
  areas for each row. However we would only want to really cache the
  heights if the request is intended for the layouting widgets real
  allocation.
  
  In some cases the layouting widget is requested the height for an
  arbitrary for_width, this is a special case for layouting widgets
  who need to request size for tens of thousands  of rows. For this
  case it’s only important that the layouting widget calculate
  one reasonably sized chunk of rows and return that height
  synchronously. The reasoning here is that any layouting widget is
  at least capable of synchronously calculating enough height to fill
  the screen height (or scrolled window height) in response to a single
  call to `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure`. Returning
  a perfect height for width that is larger than the screen area is
  inconsequential since after the layouting receives an allocation
  from a scrolled window it simply continues to drive the scrollbar
  values while more and more height is required for the row heights
  that are calculated in the background.
  
  ## Rendering Areas
  
  Once area sizes have been acquired at least for the rows in the
  visible area of the layouting widget they can be rendered at
  `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.snapshot` time.
  
  A crude example of how to render all the rows at the root level
  runs as follows:
  
  ```c
  GtkAllocation allocation;
  GdkRectangle cell_area = { 0, };
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  int minimum_width;
  int natural_width;
  
  gtk_widget_get_allocation (widget, &allocation);
  cell_area.width = allocation.width;
  
  valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (model, &iter);
  while (valid)
    {
      cell_area.height = get_cached_height_for_row (&iter);
  
      gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (area, model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
      gtk_cell_area_render (area, context, widget, cr,
                            &cell_area, &cell_area, state_flags, FALSE);
  
      cell_area.y += cell_area.height;
  
      valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (model, &iter);
    }
  ```
  
  Note that the cached height in this example really depends on how
  the layouting widget works. The layouting widget might decide to
  give every row its minimum or natural height or, if the model content
  is expected to fit inside the layouting widget without scrolling, it
  would make sense to calculate the allocation for each row at
  the time the widget is allocated using `func@Gtk.distribute_natural_allocation`.
  
  ## Handling Events and Driving Keyboard Focus
  
  Passing events to the area is as simple as handling events on any
  normal widget and then passing them to the [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.event]
  API as they come in. Usually [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] is only interested in
  button events, however some customized derived areas can be implemented
  who are interested in handling other events. Handling an event can
  trigger the `signal@Gtk.CellArea::focus-changed` signal to fire; as well
  as `signal@Gtk.CellArea::add-editable` in the case that an editable cell
  was clicked and needs to start editing. You can call
  [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.stopEditing] at any time to cancel any cell editing
  that is currently in progress.
  
  The [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] drives keyboard focus from cell to cell in a way
  similar to [gtk.widget.Widget]. For layouting widgets that support giving
  focus to cells it’s important to remember to pass [gtk.types.CellRendererState.Focused]
  to the area functions for the row that has focus and to tell the
  area to paint the focus at render time.
  
  Layouting widgets that accept focus on cells should implement the
  `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.focus` virtual method. The layouting widget is always
  responsible for knowing where [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] rows are rendered inside
  the widget, so at `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.focus` time the layouting widget
  should use the [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] methods to navigate focus inside the area
  and then observe the [gtk.types.DirectionType] to pass the focus to adjacent
  rows and areas.
  
  A basic example of how the `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.focus` virtual method
  should be implemented:
  
  ```
  static gboolean
  foo_focus (GtkWidget       *widget,
             GtkDirectionType direction)
  {
    Foo *self = FOO (widget);
    FooPrivate *priv = foo_get_instance_private (self);
    int focus_row = priv->focus_row;
    gboolean have_focus = FALSE;
  
    if (!gtk_widget_has_focus (widget))
      gtk_widget_grab_focus (widget);
  
    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, priv->focus_row);
    while (valid)
      {
        gtk_cell_area_apply_attributes (priv->area, priv->model, &iter, FALSE, FALSE);
  
        if (gtk_cell_area_focus (priv->area, direction))
          {
             priv->focus_row = focus_row;
             have_focus = TRUE;
             break;
          }
        else
          {
            if (direction == GTK_DIR_RIGHT ||
                direction == GTK_DIR_LEFT)
              break;
            else if (direction == GTK_DIR_UP ||
                     direction == GTK_DIR_TAB_BACKWARD)
             {
                if (focus_row == 0)
                  break;
                else
                 {
                    focus_row--;
                    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (priv->model, &iter, NULL, focus_row);
                 }
              }
            else
              {
                if (focus_row == last_row)
                  break;
                else
                  {
                    focus_row++;
                    valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (priv->model, &iter);
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      return have_focus;
  }
  ```
  
  Note that the layouting widget is responsible for matching the
  [gtk.types.DirectionType] values to the way it lays out its cells.
  
  ## Cell Properties
  
  The [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] introduces cell properties for [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]s.
  This provides some general interfaces for defining the relationship
  cell areas have with their cells. For instance in a [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox]
  a cell might “expand” and receive extra space when the area is allocated
  more than its full natural request, or a cell might be configured to “align”
  with adjacent rows which were requested and rendered with the same
  [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext].
  
  Use [gtk.cell_area_class.CellAreaClass.installCellProperty] to install cell
  properties for a cell area class and [gtk.cell_area_class.CellAreaClass.findCellProperty]
  or [gtk.cell_area_class.CellAreaClass.listCellProperties] to get information about
  existing cell properties.
  
  To set the value of a cell property, use [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellSetProperty],
  [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellSet] or [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellSetValist]. To obtain
  the value of a cell property, use [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellGetProperty]
  [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellGet] or [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellGetValist].

/**
    A cell area that renders GtkCellRenderers into a row or a column
  
  The [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox] renders cell renderers into a row or a column
  depending on its [gtk.types.Orientation].
  
  GtkCellAreaBox uses a notion of packing. Packing
  refers to adding cell renderers with reference to a particular position
  in a [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox]. There are two reference positions: the
  start and the end of the box.
  When the [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox] is oriented in the [gtk.types.Orientation.Vertical]
  orientation, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
  defined as the bottom. In the [gtk.types.Orientation.Horizontal] orientation
  start is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right
  side.
  
  Alignments of [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]s rendered in adjacent rows can be
  configured by configuring the [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox] align child cell property
  with [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.cellSetProperty] or by specifying the "align"
  argument to [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox.packStart] and [gtk.cell_area_box.CellAreaBox.packEnd].

/**
    An interface for packing cells
  
  [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
  want to provide a [gtk.tree_view_column.TreeViewColumn] like API for packing cells,
  setting attributes and data funcs.
  
  One of the notable features provided by implementations of
  [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
  in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
  properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
  tree model with [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout.setAttributes], which means that the value
  of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
  the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
  [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout.setCellDataFunc] that is called to determine the
  value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.
  
  ## GtkCellLayouts as GtkBuildable
  
  Implementations of GtkCellLayout which also implement the GtkBuildable
  interface ([gtk.cell_view.CellView], [gtk.icon_view.IconView], [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox],
  [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion], [gtk.tree_view_column.TreeViewColumn]) accept [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer] objects
  as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
  element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
  elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
  a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
  attribute value.
  
  This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkCellView">
    <child>
      <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
      <attributes>
        <attribute name="text">0</attribute>
      </attributes>
    </child>
  </object>
  ```
  
  Furthermore for implementations of [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] that use a [gtk.cell_area.CellArea]
  to lay out cells (all [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout]s in GTK use a [gtk.cell_area.CellArea])
  [cell properties](class.CellArea.html#cell-properties) can also be defined
  in the format by specifying the custom `<cell-packing>` attribute which can
  contain multiple `<property>` elements.
  
  Here is a UI definition fragment specifying cell properties:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkTreeViewColumn">
    <child>
      <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
      <cell-packing>
        <property name="align">True</property>
        <property name="expand">False</property>
      </cell-packing>
    </child>
  </object>
  ```
  
  ## Subclassing GtkCellLayout implementations
  
  When subclassing a widget that implements [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] like
  [gtk.icon_view.IconView] or [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox], there are some considerations related
  to the fact that these widgets internally use a [gtk.cell_area.CellArea].
  The cell area is exposed as a construct-only property by these
  widgets. This means that it is possible to e.g. do
  
  ```c
  GtkWIdget *combo =
    g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);
  ```
  
  to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
  are only initialized after instance `init()`
  functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
  the existence of the cell area in your subclass `init()` function will
  cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
  construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
  you to the problem).
  
  ```c
  static void
  my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
  {
    GtkCellRenderer *cell;
  
    cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();
  
    // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
    // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
    gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
    ...
  }
  
  GtkWidget *
  my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
  {
    // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
    return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
  }
  ```
  
  If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
  not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
  to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
  problematic calls out of `init()` and into a `constructor()`
  for your class.

  specific way.  It is worth noting that [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer] is not a
  [gtk.widget.Widget] and cannot be treated as such.
  
  The primary use of a [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer] is for drawing a certain graphical
  elements on a [cairo.context.Context]. Typically, one cell renderer is used to
  draw many cells on the screen.  To this extent, it isn’t expected that a
  CellRenderer keep any permanent state around.  Instead, any state is set
  just prior to use using [gobject.object.ObjectG]s property system.  Then, the
  cell is measured using [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer.getPreferredSize]. Finally, the cell
  is rendered in the correct location using [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer.snapshot].
  
  There are a number of rules that must be followed when writing a new
  [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer].  First and foremost, it’s important that a certain set
  of properties will always yield a cell renderer of the same size,
  barring a style change. The [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer] also has a number of
  generic properties that are expected to be honored by all children.
  
  Beyond merely rendering a cell, cell renderers can optionally
  provide active user interface elements. A cell renderer can be
  “activatable” like [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]Toggle,
  which toggles when it gets activated by a mouse click, or it can be
  “editable” like [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]Text, which
  allows the user to edit the text using a widget implementing the
  [gtk.cell_editable.CellEditable] interface, e.g. [gtk.entry.Entry].
  To make a cell renderer activatable or editable, you have to
  implement the [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]Class.activate or
  [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer]Class.start_editing virtual functions, respectively.
  
  Many properties of [gtk.cell_renderer.CellRenderer] and its subclasses have a
  corresponding “set” property, e.g. “cell-background-set” corresponds
  to “cell-background”. These “set” properties reflect whether a property
  has been set or not. You should not set them independently.

  [gtk.check_button.CheckButton.setActive], and retrieved using
  [gtk.check_button.CheckButton.getActive].
  
  # Inconsistent state
  
  In addition to "on" and "off", check buttons can be an
  "in between" state that is neither on nor off. This can be used
  e.g. when the user has selected a range of elements (such as some
  text or spreadsheet cells) that are affected by a check button,
  and the current values in that range are inconsistent.
  
  To set a [gtk.check_button.CheckButton] to inconsistent state, use
  [gtk.check_button.CheckButton.setInconsistent].
  
  # Grouping
  
  Check buttons can be grouped together, to form mutually exclusive
  groups - only one of the buttons can be toggled at a time, and toggling
  another one will switch the currently toggled one off.
  
  Grouped check buttons use a different indicator, and are commonly referred

  is recommended to keep track of such state through a stateful

    [gtk.column_view.ColumnView] presents a large dynamic list of items using multiple columns
  with headers.
  
  [gtk.column_view.ColumnView] uses the factories of its columns to generate a cell widget for
  each column, for each visible item and displays them together as the row for
  this item.
  
  The `property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-row-separators` and
  `property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-column-separators` properties offer a simple way
  to display separators between the rows or columns.
  
  [gtk.column_view.ColumnView] allows the user to select items according to the selection
  characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
  it is possible to turn on *rubberband selection*, using
  `property@Gtk.ColumnView:enable-rubberband`.
  
  The column view supports sorting that can be customized by the user by
  clicking on column headers. To set this up, the [gtk.sorter.Sorter] returned by
  [gtk.column_view.ColumnView.getSorter] must be attached to a sort model for the
  data that the view is showing, and the columns must have sorters attached to
  them by calling [gtk.column_view_column.ColumnViewColumn.setSorter]. The initial sort
  order can be set with [gtk.column_view.ColumnView.sortByColumn].
  
  The column view also supports interactive resizing and reordering of
  columns, via Drag-and-Drop of the column headers. This can be enabled or
  disabled with the [gtk.column_view.ColumnView.gboolean] and
  [gtk.column_view_column.ColumnViewColumn.gboolean] properties.

  [gtk.column_view.ColumnView] uses a single CSS node named columnview. It may carry the
  .column-separators style class, when `property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-column-separators`
  property is set. Header widgets appear below a node with name header.
  The rows are contained in a [gtk.list_view.ListView] widget, so there is a listview
  node with the same structure as for a standalone [gtk.list_view.ListView] widget.
  If `property@Gtk.ColumnView:show-row-separators` is set, it will be passed
  on to the list view, causing its CSS node to carry the .separators style class.
  For rubberband selection, a node with name rubberband is used.
  
  The main columnview node may also carry style classes to select
  the style of [list presentation](section-list-widget.html#list-styles):
  .rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

    A [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] is a widget that allows the user to choose from a list of
  valid choices.
  
  ![An example GtkComboBox](combo-box.png)
  
  The [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] displays the selected choice; when activated, the
  [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] displays a popup which allows the user to make a new choice.
  
  The [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] uses the model-view pattern; the list of valid choices
  is specified in the form of a tree model, and the display of the choices
  can be adapted to the data in the model by using cell renderers, as you
  would in a tree view. This is possible since [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] implements the
  [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] interface. The tree model holding the valid
  choices is not restricted to a flat list, it can be a real tree, and the
  popup will reflect the tree structure.
  
  To allow the user to enter values not in the model, the
  `property@Gtk.ComboBox:has-entry` property allows the [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] to
  contain a [gtk.entry.Entry]. This entry can be accessed by calling
  [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox.getChild] on the combo box.
  
  For a simple list of textual choices, the model-view API of [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox]
  can be a bit overwhelming. In this case, [gtk.combo_box_text.ComboBoxText] offers
  a simple alternative. Both [gtk.combo_box.ComboBox] and [gtk.combo_box_text.ComboBoxText] can contain
  an entry.

/**
    A layout manager using constraints to describe relations between widgets.
  
  [gtk.constraint_layout.ConstraintLayout] is a layout manager that uses relations between
  widget attributes, expressed via [gtk.constraint.Constraint] instances, to
  measure and allocate widgets.
  
  ### How do constraints work
  
  Constraints are objects defining the relationship between attributes
  of a widget; you can read the description of the [gtk.constraint.Constraint]
  class to have a more in depth definition.
  
  By taking multiple constraints and applying them to the children of
  a widget using [gtk.constraint_layout.ConstraintLayout], it's possible to describe
  complex layout policies; each constraint applied to a child or to the parent
  widgets contributes to the full description of the layout, in terms of
  parameters for resolving the value of each attribute.
  
  It is important to note that a layout is defined by the totality of
  constraints; removing a child, or a constraint, from an existing layout
  without changing the remaining constraints may result in an unstable
  or unsolvable layout.
  
  Constraints have an implicit "reading order"; you should start describing
  each edge of each child, as well as their relationship with the parent
  container, from the top left (or top right, in RTL languages), horizontally
  first, and then vertically.
  
  A constraint-based layout with too few constraints can become "unstable",
  that is: have more than one solution. The behavior of an unstable layout
  is undefined.
  
  A constraint-based layout with conflicting constraints may be unsolvable,
  and lead to an unstable layout. You can use the [gtk.constraint.Constraint.gint]
  property of [gtk.constraint.Constraint] to "nudge" the layout towards a solution.
  
  ### GtkConstraintLayout as GtkBuildable
  
  [gtk.constraint_layout.ConstraintLayout] implements the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface and
  has a custom "constraints" element which allows describing constraints in
  a [gtk.builder.Builder] UI file.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment specifying a constraint:
  
  ```xml
    <object class="GtkConstraintLayout">
      <constraints>
        <constraint target="button" target-attribute="start"
                    relation="eq"
                    source="super" source-attribute="start"
                    constant="12"
                    strength="required" />
        <constraint target="button" target-attribute="width"
                    relation="ge"
                    constant="250"
                    strength="strong" />
      </constraints>
    </object>
  ```
  
  The definition above will add two constraints to the GtkConstraintLayout:
  
   $(LIST
      * a required constraint between the leading edge of "button" and
        the leading edge of the widget using the constraint layout, plus
        12 pixels
      * a strong, constant constraint making the width of "button" greater
        than, or equal to 250 pixels
   )
     
  The "target" and "target-attribute" attributes are required.
  
  The "source" and "source-attribute" attributes of the "constraint"
  element are optional; if they are not specified, the constraint is
  assumed to be a constant.
  
  The "relation" attribute is optional; if not specified, the constraint
  is assumed to be an equality.
  
  The "strength" attribute is optional; if not specified, the constraint
  is assumed to be required.
  
  The "source" and "target" attributes can be set to "super" to indicate
  that the constraint target is the widget using the GtkConstraintLayout.
  
  There can be "constant" and "multiplier" attributes.
  
  Additionally, the "constraints" element can also contain a description
  of the `GtkConstraintGuides` used by the layout:
  
  ```xml
    <constraints>
      <guide min-width="100" max-width="500" name="hspace"/>
      <guide min-height="64" nat-height="128" name="vspace" strength="strong"/>
    </constraints>
  ```
  
  The "guide" element has the following optional attributes:
  
    $(LIST
        * "min-width", "nat-width", and "max-width", describe the minimum,
          natural, and maximum width of the guide, respectively
        * "min-height", "nat-height", and "max-height", describe the minimum,
          natural, and maximum height of the guide, respectively
        * "strength" describes the strength of the constraint on the natural
          size of the guide; if not specified, the constraint is assumed to
          have a medium strength
        * "name" describes a name for the guide, useful when debugging
    )
      
  ### Using the Visual Format Language
  
  Complex constraints can be described using a compact syntax called VFL,
  or *Visual Format Language*.
  
  The Visual Format Language describes all the constraints on a row or
  column, typically starting from the leading edge towards the trailing
  one. Each element of the layout is composed by "views", which identify
  a [gtk.constraint_target.ConstraintTarget].
  
  For instance:
  
  ```
    [button]-[textField]
  ```
  
  Describes a constraint that binds the trailing edge of "button" to the
  leading edge of "textField", leaving a default space between the two.
  
  Using VFL is also possible to specify predicates that describe constraints
  on attributes like width and height:
  
  ```
    // Width must be greater than, or equal to 50
    [button(>=50)]
  
    // Width of button1 must be equal to width of button2
    [button1(==button2)]
  ```
  
  The default orientation for a VFL description is horizontal, unless
  otherwise specified:
  
  ```
    // horizontal orientation, default attribute: width
    H:[button(>=150)]
  
    // vertical orientation, default attribute: height
    V:[button1(==button2)]
  ```
  
  It's also possible to specify multiple predicates, as well as their
  strength:
  
  ```
    // minimum width of button must be 150
    // natural width of button can be 250
    [button(>=150@required, ==250@medium)]
  ```
  
  Finally, it's also possible to use simple arithmetic operators:
  
  ```
    // width of button1 must be equal to width of button2
    // divided by 2 plus 12
    [button1(button2 / 2 + 12)]
  ```

    Dialogs are a convenient way to prompt the user for a small amount
  of input.
  
  ![An example GtkDialog](dialog.png)
  
  Typical uses are to display a message, ask a question, or anything else
  that does not require extensive effort on the user’s part.
  
  The main area of a [gtk.dialog.Dialog] is called the "content area", and is yours
  to populate with widgets such a [gtk.label.Label] or [gtk.entry.Entry], to present
  your information, questions, or tasks to the user.
  
  In addition, dialogs allow you to add "action widgets". Most commonly,
  action widgets are buttons. Depending on the platform, action widgets may
  be presented in the header bar at the top of the window, or at the bottom
  of the window. To add action widgets, create your [gtk.dialog.Dialog] using
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog.newWithButtons], or use
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog.addButton], [gtk.dialog.Dialog.addButtons],
  or [gtk.dialog.Dialog.addActionWidget].
  
  `GtkDialogs` uses some heuristics to decide whether to add a close
  button to the window decorations. If any of the action buttons use
  the response ID [gtk.types.ResponseType.Close] or [gtk.types.ResponseType.Cancel], the
  close button is omitted.
  
  Clicking a button that was added as an action widget will emit the
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog.response] signal with a response ID that you specified.
  GTK will never assign a meaning to positive response IDs; these are
  entirely user-defined. But for convenience, you can use the response
  IDs in the [gtk.types.ResponseType] enumeration (these all have values
  less than zero). If a dialog receives a delete event, the
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog.response] signal will be emitted with the
  [gtk.types.ResponseType.DeleteEvent] response ID.
  
  Dialogs are created with a call to [gtk.dialog.Dialog.new_] or
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog.newWithButtons]. The latter is recommended; it allows
  you to set the dialog title, some convenient flags, and add buttons.
  
  A “modal” dialog (that is, one which freezes the rest of the application
  from user input), can be created by calling [gtk.window.Window.setModal]
  on the dialog. When using [gtk.dialog.Dialog.newWithButtons], you can also
  pass the [gtk.types.DialogFlags.Modal] flag to make a dialog modal.
  
  For the simple dialog in the following example, a [gtk.message_dialog.MessageDialog]
  would save some effort. But you’d need to create the dialog contents manually
  if you had more than a simple message in the dialog.
  
  An example for simple [gtk.dialog.Dialog] usage:
  
  ```c
  // Function to open a dialog box with a message
  void
  quick_message (GtkWindow *parent, char *message)
  {
   GtkWidget *dialog, *label, *content_area;
   GtkDialogFlags flags;
  
   // Create the widgets
   flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
   dialog = gtk_dialog_new_with_buttons ("Message",
                                         parent,
                                         flags,
                                         _("_OK"),
                                         GTK_RESPONSE_NONE,
                                         NULL);
   content_area = gtk_dialog_get_content_area (GTK_DIALOG (dialog));
   label = gtk_label_new (message);
  
   // Ensure that the dialog box is destroyed when the user responds
  
   g_signal_connect_swapped (dialog,
                             "response",
                             G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                             dialog);
  
   // Add the label, and show everything we’ve added
  
   gtk_box_append (GTK_BOX (content_area), label);
   gtk_widget_show (dialog);
  }
  ```
  
  # GtkDialog as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.dialog.Dialog] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface exposes the
  @content_area as an internal child with the name “content_area”.
  
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog] supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
  multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
  numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
  (which should be a child of the dialogs @action_area). To mark a response
  as default, set the “default” attribute of the `<action-widget>` element
  to true.
  
  [gtk.dialog.Dialog] supports adding action widgets by specifying “action” as
  the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
  either to the action area or the headerbar of the dialog, depending
  on the “use-header-bar” property. The response id has to be associated
  with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.
  
  An example of a [gtk.dialog.Dialog] UI definition fragment:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkDialog" id="dialog1">
    <child type="action">
      <object class="GtkButton" id="button_cancel"/>
    </child>
    <child type="action">
      <object class="GtkButton" id="button_ok">
      </object>
    </child>
    <action-widgets>
      <action-widget response="cancel">button_cancel</action-widget>
      <action-widget response="ok" default="true">button_ok</action-widget>
    </action-widgets>
  </object>

    [gtk.drag_source.DragSource] is an event controller to initiate Drag-And-Drop operations.
  
  [gtk.drag_source.DragSource] can be set up with the necessary
  ingredients for a DND operation ahead of time. This includes
  the source for the data that is being transferred, in the form
  of a [gdk.content_provider.ContentProvider], the desired action, and the icon to
  use during the drag operation. After setting it up, the drag
  source must be added to a widget as an event controller, using
  [gtk.widget.Widget.addController].
  
  ```c
  static void
  my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
  {
    GtkDragSource *drag_source = gtk_drag_source_new ();
  
    g_signal_connect (drag_source, "prepare", G_CALLBACK (on_drag_prepare), self);
    g_signal_connect (drag_source, "drag-begin", G_CALLBACK (on_drag_begin), self);
  
    gtk_widget_add_controller (GTK_WIDGET (self), GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER (drag_source));
  }
  ```
  
  Setting up the content provider and icon ahead of time only makes
  sense when the data does not change. More commonly, you will want
  to set them up just in time. To do so, [gtk.drag_source.DragSource] has
  [gtk.drag_source.DragSource.prepare] and `signal@Gtk.DragSource::drag-begin`
  signals.
  
  The ::prepare signal is emitted before a drag is started, and
  can be used to set the content provider and actions that the
  drag should be started with.
  
  ```c
  static GdkContentProvider *
  on_drag_prepare (GtkDragSource *source,
                   double         x,
                   double         y,
                   MyWidget      *self)
  {
    // This widget supports two types of content: GFile objects
    // and GdkPixbuf objects; GTK will handle the serialization
    // of these types automatically
    GFile *file = my_widget_get_file (self);
    GdkPixbuf *pixbuf = my_widget_get_pixbuf (self);
  
    return gdk_content_provider_new_union ((GdkContentProvider *[2]) {
        gdk_content_provider_new_typed (G_TYPE_FILE, file),
        gdk_content_provider_new_typed (GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF, pixbuf),
      }, 2);
  }
  ```
  
  The ::drag-begin signal is emitted after the [gdk.drag.Drag] object has
  been created, and can be used to set up the drag icon.
  
  ```c
  static void
  on_drag_begin (GtkDragSource *source,
                 GdkDrag       *drag,
                 MyWidget      *self)
  {
    // Set the widget as the drag icon
    GdkPaintable *paintable = gtk_widget_paintable_new (GTK_WIDGET (self));
    gtk_drag_source_set_icon (source, paintable, 0, 0);
    g_object_unref (paintable);
  }
  ```
  
  During the DND operation, [gtk.drag_source.DragSource] emits signals that
  can be used to obtain updates about the status of the operation,
  but it is not normally necessary to connect to any signals,
  except for one case: when the supported actions include
  [gdk.types.DragAction.Move], you need to listen for the
  `signal@Gtk.DragSource::drag-end` signal and delete the
  data after it has been transferred.

    [gtk.drawing_area.DrawingArea] is a widget that allows drawing with cairo.
  
  ![An example GtkDrawingArea](drawingarea.png)
  
  It’s essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
  creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:
  
  $(LIST
    * The [gtk.widget.Widget.realize] signal to take any necessary actions
      when the widget is instantiated on a particular display.
      (Create GDK resources in response to this signal.)
    
    * The [gtk.drawing_area.DrawingArea.resize] signal to take any necessary
      actions when the widget changes size.
    
    * Call [gtk.drawing_area.DrawingArea.setDrawFunc] to handle redrawing the
      contents of the widget.
  )
    
  The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing
  area to display a circle in the normal widget foreground
  color.
  
  ## Simple GtkDrawingArea usage
  
  ```c
  static void
  draw_function (GtkDrawingArea *area,
                 cairo_t        *cr,
                 int             width,
                 int             height,
                 gpointer        data)
  {
    GdkRGBA color;
  
    cairo_arc (cr,
               width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
               MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
               0, 2 * G_PI);
  
    gtk_widget_get_color (GTK_WIDGET (area),
                          &color);
    gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);
  
    cairo_fill (cr);
  }
  
  int
  main (int argc, char **argv)
  {
    gtk_init ();
  
    GtkWidget *area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
    gtk_drawing_area_set_content_width (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
    gtk_drawing_area_set_content_height (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area), 100);
    gtk_drawing_area_set_draw_func (GTK_DRAWING_AREA (area),
                                    draw_function,
                                    NULL, NULL);
    return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  The draw function is normally called when a drawing area first comes
  onscreen, or when it’s covered by another window and then uncovered.
  You can also force a redraw by adding to the “damage region” of the
  drawing area’s window using [gtk.widget.Widget.queueDraw].
  This will cause the drawing area to call the draw function again.
  
  The available routines for drawing are documented in the
  [Cairo documentation](https://www.cairographics.org/manual/); GDK
  offers additional API to integrate with Cairo, like `func@Gdk.cairo_set_source_rgba`
  or `func@Gdk.cairo_set_source_pixbuf`.
  
  To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to use
  event controllers. To receive keyboard events, you will need to set
  the “can-focus” property on the drawing area, and you should probably
  draw some user-visible indication that the drawing area is focused.
  
  If you need more complex control over your widget, you should consider
  creating your own [gtk.widget.Widget] subclass.

    [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] is a widget that allows the user to choose an item
  from a list of options.
  
  ![An example GtkDropDown](drop-down.png)
  
  The [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] displays the [selected][gtk.drop_down.DropDown.guint]
  choice.
  
  The options are given to [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] in the form of [gio.list_model.ListModel]
  and how the individual options are represented is determined by
  a [gtk.list_item_factory.ListItemFactory]. The default factory displays simple strings,
  and adds a checkmark to the selected item in the popup.
  
  To set your own factory, use [gtk.drop_down.DropDown.setFactory]. It is
  possible to use a separate factory for the items in the popup, with
  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown.setListFactory].
  
  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] knows how to obtain strings from the items in a
  [gtk.string_list.StringList]; for other models, you have to provide an expression
  to find the strings via [gtk.drop_down.DropDown.setExpression].
  
  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] can optionally allow search in the popup, which is
  useful if the list of options is long. To enable the search entry,
  use [gtk.drop_down.DropDown.setEnableSearch].
  
  Here is a UI definition example for [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] with a simple model:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkDropDown">
    <property name="model">
      <object class="GtkStringList">
        <items>
          <item translatable="yes">Factory</item>
          <item translatable="yes">Home</item>
          <item translatable="yes">Subway</item>
        </items>
      </object>
    </property>
  </object>
  ```
  
  If a [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] is created in this manner, or with
  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown.newFromStrings], for instance, the object returned from
  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown.getSelectedItem] will be a [gtk.string_object.StringObject].
  
  To learn more about the list widget framework, see the
  [overview](section-list-widget.html).
  
  ## CSS nodes
  
  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] has a single CSS node with name dropdown,
  with the button and popover nodes as children.

  [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] uses the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.ComboBox] role.

    [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget] is an event controller to receive Drag-and-Drop operations.
  
  The most basic way to use a [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget] to receive drops on a
  widget is to create it via [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.new_], passing in the
  [gobject.types.TYPE_FLAG_RESERVED_ID_BIT] of the data you want to receive and connect to the
  [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.drop] signal to receive the data:
  
  ```c
  static gboolean
  on_drop (GtkDropTarget *target,
           const GValue  *value,
           double         x,
           double         y,
           gpointer       data)
  {
    MyWidget *self = data;
  
    // Call the appropriate setter depending on the type of data
    // that we received
    if (G_VALUE_HOLDS (value, G_TYPE_FILE))
      my_widget_set_file (self, g_value_get_object (value));
    else if (G_VALUE_HOLDS (value, GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF))
      my_widget_set_pixbuf (self, g_value_get_object (value));
    else
      return FALSE;
  
    return TRUE;
  }
  
  static void
  my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
  {
    GtkDropTarget *target =
      gtk_drop_target_new (G_TYPE_INVALID, GDK_ACTION_COPY);
  
    // This widget accepts two types of drop types: GFile objects
    // and GdkPixbuf objects
    gtk_drop_target_set_gtypes (target, (GType [2]) {
      G_TYPE_FILE,
      GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF,
    }, 2);
  
    g_signal_connect (target, "drop", G_CALLBACK (on_drop), self);
    gtk_widget_add_controller (GTK_WIDGET (self), GTK_EVENT_CONTROLLER (target));
  }
  ```
  
  [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget] supports more options, such as:
  
   $(LIST
      * rejecting potential drops via the [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.accept] signal
        and the [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.reject] function to let other drop
        targets handle the drop
      * tracking an ongoing drag operation before the drop via the
        [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.enter], [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.motion] and
        [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.leave] signals
      * configuring how to receive data by setting the
        [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.gboolean] property and listening for its
        availability via the [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget.GObject.Value] property
   )
     
  However, [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget] is ultimately modeled in a synchronous way
  and only supports data transferred via [gobject.types.TYPE_FLAG_RESERVED_ID_BIT]. If you want full control
  over an ongoing drop, the [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync] object gives you
  this ability.
  
  While a pointer is dragged over the drop target's widget and the drop
  has not been rejected, that widget will receive the
  [gtk.types.StateFlags.DropActive] state, which can be used to style the widget.
  
  If you are not interested in receiving the drop, but just want to update
  UI state during a Drag-and-Drop operation (e.g. switching tabs), you can
  use [gtk.drop_controller_motion.DropControllerMotion].
*/
struct GtkDropTarget;

/**
    [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync] is an event controller to receive Drag-and-Drop
  operations, asynchronously.
  
  It is the more complete but also more complex method of handling drop
  operations compared to [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget], and you should only use
  it if [gtk.drop_target.DropTarget] doesn't provide all the features you need.
  
  To use a [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync] to receive drops on a widget, you create
  a [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync] object, configure which data formats and actions
  you support, connect to its signals, and then attach it to the widget
  with [gtk.widget.Widget.addController].
  
  During a drag operation, the first signal that a [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync]
  emits is [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync.accept], which is meant to determine
  whether the target is a possible drop site for the ongoing drop. The
  default handler for the ::accept signal accepts the drop if it finds
  a compatible data format and an action that is supported on both sides.
  
  If it is, and the widget becomes a target, you will receive a
  `signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drag-enter` signal, followed by
  `signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drag-motion` signals as the pointer moves,
  optionally a [gtk.drop_target_async.DropTargetAsync.drop] signal when a drop happens,
  and finally a `signal@Gtk.DropTargetAsync::drag-leave` signal when the
  pointer moves off the widget.
  
  The ::drag-enter and ::drag-motion handler return a [gdk.types.DragAction]
  to update the status of the ongoing operation. The ::drop handler
  should decide if it ultimately accepts the drop and if it does, it
  should initiate the data transfer and finish the operation by calling
  [gdk.drop.Drop.finish].
  
  Between the ::drag-enter and ::drag-leave signals the widget is a
  current drop target, and will receive the [gtk.types.StateFlags.DropActive]
  state, which can be used by themes to style the widget as a drop target.

    [gtk.editable.Editable] is an interface for text editing widgets.
  
  Typical examples of editable widgets are [gtk.entry.Entry] and
  [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton]. It contains functions for generically manipulating
  an editable widget, a large number of action signals used for key bindings,
  and several signals that an application can connect to modify the behavior
  of a widget.
  
  As an example of the latter usage, by connecting the following handler to
  `signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text`, an application can convert all entry
  into a widget into uppercase.
  
  ## Forcing entry to uppercase.
  
  ```c
  #include <ctype.h>
  
  void
  insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
                       const char  *text,
                       int          length,
                       int         *position,
                       gpointer     data)
  {
    char *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);
  
    g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
                                 (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
    gtk_editable_insert_text (editable, result, length, position);
    g_signal_handlers_unblock_by_func (editable,
                                       (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
  
    g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (editable, "insert_text");
  
    g_free (result);
  }
  ```
  
  ## Implementing GtkEditable
  
  The most likely scenario for implementing [gtk.editable.Editable] on your own widget
  is that you will embed a [gtk.text.Text] inside a complex widget, and want to
  delegate the editable functionality to that text widget. [gtk.editable.Editable]
  provides some utility functions to make this easy.
  
  In your class_init function, call [gtk.editable.Editable.installProperties],
  passing the first available property ID:
  
  ```c
  static void
  my_class_init (MyClass *class)
  {
    ...
    g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, NUM_PROPERTIES, props);
    gtk_editable_install_properties (object_clas, NUM_PROPERTIES);
    ...
  }
  ```
  
  In your interface_init function for the [gtk.editable.Editable] interface, provide
  an implementation for the get_delegate vfunc that returns your text widget:
  
  ```c
  GtkEditable *
  get_editable_delegate (GtkEditable *editable)
  {
    return GTK_EDITABLE (MY_WIDGET (editable)->text_widget);
  }
  
  static void
  my_editable_init (GtkEditableInterface *iface)
  {
    iface->get_delegate = get_editable_delegate;
  }
  ```
  
  You don't need to provide any other vfuncs. The default implementations
  work by forwarding to the delegate that the GtkEditableInterface.get_delegate()
  vfunc returns.
  
  In your instance_init function, create your text widget, and then call
  [gtk.editable.Editable.initDelegate]:
  
  ```c
  static void
  my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
  {
    ...
    self->text_widget = gtk_text_new ();
    gtk_editable_init_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
    ...
  }
  ```
  
  In your dispose function, call [gtk.editable.Editable.finishDelegate] before
  destroying your text widget:
  
  ```c
  static void
  my_widget_dispose (GObject *object)
  {
    ...
    gtk_editable_finish_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
    g_clear_pointer (&self->text_widget, gtk_widget_unparent);
    ...
  }
  ```
  
  Finally, use [gtk.editable.Editable.delegateSetProperty] in your `set_property`
  function (and similar for `get_property`), to set the editable properties:
  
  ```c
    ...
    if (gtk_editable_delegate_set_property (object, prop_id, value, pspec))
      return;
  
    switch (prop_id)
    ...
  ```
  
  It is important to note that if you create a [gtk.editable.Editable] that uses
  a delegate, the low level `signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text` and
  `signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text` signals will be propagated from the
  "wrapper" editable to the delegate, but they will not be propagated from
  the delegate to the "wrapper" editable, as they would cause an infinite
  recursion. If you wish to connect to the `signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text`
  and `signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text` signals, you will need to connect
  to them on the delegate obtained via [gtk.editable.Editable.getDelegate].

/**
    [gtk.entry.Entry] is a single line text entry widget.
  
  ![An example GtkEntry](entry.png)
  
  A fairly large set of key bindings are supported by default. If the
  entered text is longer than the allocation of the widget, the widget
  will scroll so that the cursor position is visible.
  
  When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information, it
  can be put into “password mode” using [gtk.entry.Entry.setVisibility].
  In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
  By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
  in the current font, but it can be changed with
  [gtk.entry.Entry.setInvisibleChar].
  
  [gtk.entry.Entry] has the ability to display progress or activity
  information behind the text. To make an entry display such information,
  use [gtk.entry.Entry.setProgressFraction] or
  [gtk.entry.Entry.setProgressPulseStep].
  
  Additionally, [gtk.entry.Entry] can show icons at either side of the entry.
  These icons can be activatable by clicking, can be set up as drag source
  and can have tooltips. To add an icon, use
  [gtk.entry.Entry.setIconFromGicon] or one of the various other functions
  that set an icon from an icon name or a paintable. To trigger an action when
  the user clicks an icon, connect to the `signal@Gtk.Entry::icon-press` signal.
  To allow DND operations from an icon, use
  [gtk.entry.Entry.setIconDragSource]. To set a tooltip on an icon, use
  [gtk.entry.Entry.setIconTooltipText] or the corresponding function
  for markup.
  
  Note that functionality or information that is only available by clicking
  on an icon in an entry may not be accessible at all to users which are not
  able to use a mouse or other pointing device. It is therefore recommended
  that any such functionality should also be available by other means, e.g.
  via the context menu of the entry.

  [gtk.entry.Entry] has a main node with the name entry. Depending on the properties
  of the entry, the style classes .read-only and .flat may appear. The style
  classes .warning and .error may also be used with entries.
  
  When the entry shows icons, it adds subnodes with the name image and the
  style class .left or .right, depending on where the icon appears.
  
  When the entry shows progress, it adds a subnode with the name progress.
  The node has the style class .pulse when the shown progress is pulsing.
  
  For all the subnodes added to the text node in various situations,
  see [gtk.text.Text].
  
  # GtkEntry as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.entry.Entry] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface supports a
  custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
  elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
  “start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify [pango.attribute.Attribute] values for
  this label.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkEntry">
    <attributes>
      <attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/>
      <attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/>
    </attributes>
  </object>
  ```
  
  The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
  Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute
  is applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
  sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
  content instead.

    [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion] is an auxiliary object to provide completion functionality
  for [gtk.entry.Entry].
  
  It implements the [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] interface, to allow the user
  to add extra cells to the [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] with completion matches.
  
  “Completion functionality” means that when the user modifies the text
  in the entry, [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion] checks which rows in the model match
  the current content of the entry, and displays a list of matches.
  By default, the matching is done by comparing the entry text
  case-insensitively against the text column of the model (see
  [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion.setTextColumn]), but this can be overridden
  with a custom match function (see [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion.setMatchFunc]).
  
  When the user selects a completion, the content of the entry is
  updated. By default, the content of the entry is replaced by the
  text column of the model, but this can be overridden by connecting
  to the `signal@Gtk.EntryCompletion::match-selected` signal and updating the
  entry in the signal handler. Note that you should return true from
  the signal handler to suppress the default behaviour.
  
  To add completion functionality to an entry, use
  [gtk.entry.Entry.setCompletion].
  
  [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion] uses a [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] model to
  represent the subset of the entire model that is currently matching.
  While the [gtk.entry_completion.EntryCompletion] signals
  `signal@Gtk.EntryCompletion::match-selected` and
  `signal@Gtk.EntryCompletion::cursor-on-match` take the original model
  and an iter pointing to that model as arguments, other callbacks and
  signals (such as [gtk.types.CellLayoutDataFunc] or
  `signal@Gtk.CellArea::apply-attributes)`
  will generally take the filter model as argument. As long as you are
  only calling [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.get], this will make no difference to
  you. If for some reason, you need the original model, use
  [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter.getModel]. Don’t forget to use
  [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter.convertIterToChildIter] to obtain a

  The behavior of the event controller can be modified by the flags

  [gtk.event_controller_scroll.EventControllerScroll.setFlags] (e.g. because the scrolling
  conditions of the widget changed).
  
  The controller can be set up to emit motion for either/both vertical
  and horizontal scroll events through [gtk.types.EventControllerScrollFlags.Vertical],
  [gtk.types.EventControllerScrollFlags.Horizontal] and [gtk.types.EventControllerScrollFlags.BothAxes].
  If any axis is disabled, the respective [gtk.event_controller_scroll.EventControllerScroll.scroll]
  delta will be 0. Vertical scroll events will be translated to horizontal
  motion for the devices incapable of horizontal scrolling.
  
  The event controller can also be forced to emit discrete events on all
  devices through [gtk.types.EventControllerScrollFlags.Discrete]. This can be used
  to implement discrete actions triggered through scroll events (e.g.
  switching across combobox options).
  
  The [gtk.types.EventControllerScrollFlags.Kinetic] flag toggles the emission of the

    [gtk.expander.Expander] allows the user to reveal its child by clicking
  on an expander triangle.
  
  ![An example GtkExpander](expander.png)
  
  This is similar to the triangles used in a [gtk.tree_view.TreeView].
  
  Normally you use an expander as you would use a frame; you create
  the child widget and use [gtk.expander.Expander.setChild] to add it
  to the expander. When the expander is toggled, it will take care of
  showing and hiding the child automatically.
  
  # Special Usage
  
  There are situations in which you may prefer to show and hide the
  expanded widget yourself, such as when you want to actually create
  the widget at expansion time. In this case, create a [gtk.expander.Expander]
  but do not add a child to it. The expander widget has an
  [gtk.expander.Expander.gboolean] property which can be used to
  monitor its expansion state. You should watch this property with
  a signal connection as follows:
  
  ```c
  static void
  expander_callback (GObject    *object,
                     GParamSpec *param_spec,
                     gpointer    user_data)
  {
    GtkExpander *expander;
  
    expander = GTK_EXPANDER (object);
  
    if (gtk_expander_get_expanded (expander))
      {
        // Show or create widgets
      }
    else
      {
        // Hide or destroy widgets
      }
  }
  
  static void
  create_expander (void)
  {
    GtkWidget *expander = gtk_expander_new_with_mnemonic ("_More Options");
    g_signal_connect (expander, "notify::expanded",
                      G_CALLBACK (expander_callback), NULL);
  
    // ...
  }
  ```
  
  # GtkExpander as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.expander.Expander] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface supports
  placing a child in the label position by specifying “label” as the
  “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. A normal content child can be
  specified without specifying a `<child>` type attribute.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment with GtkExpander:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkExpander">
    <child type="label">
      <object class="GtkLabel" id="expander-label"/>
    </child>
    <child>
      <object class="GtkEntry" id="expander-content"/>
    </child>
  </object>
  ```

      ├── title
      │   ├── expander
      │   ╰── <label widget>
      ╰── <child>
  ```
  
  [gtk.expander.Expander] has a main node `expander-widget`, and subnode `box` containing
  the title and child widget. The box subnode `title` contains node `expander`,
  i.e. the expand/collapse arrow; then the label widget if any. The arrow of an
  expander that is showing its child gets the `:checked` pseudoclass set on it.

struct GtkExpander;

/**
    [gtk.expression.Expression] provides a way to describe references to values.
  
  An important aspect of expressions is that the value can be obtained
  from a source that is several steps away. For example, an expression
  may describe ‘the value of property A of `object1`, which is itself the
  value of a property of `object2`’. And `object1` may not even exist yet
  at the time that the expression is created. This is contrast to [gobject.object.ObjectG]
  property bindings, which can only create direct connections between
  the properties of two objects that must both exist for the duration
  of the binding.
  
  An expression needs to be "evaluated" to obtain the value that it currently
  refers to. An evaluation always happens in the context of a current object
  called `this` (it mirrors the behavior of object-oriented languages),
  which may or may not influence the result of the evaluation. Use
  [gtk.expression.Expression.evaluate] for evaluating an expression.
  
  Various methods for defining expressions exist, from simple constants via
  [gtk.constant_expression.ConstantExpression.new_] to looking up properties in a [gobject.object.ObjectG]
  (even recursively) via [gtk.property_expression.PropertyExpression.new_] or providing
  custom functions to transform and combine expressions via
  [gtk.closure_expression.ClosureExpression.new_].
  
  Here is an example of a complex expression:
  
  ```c
    color_expr = gtk_property_expression_new (GTK_TYPE_LIST_ITEM,
                                              NULL, "item");
    expression = gtk_property_expression_new (GTK_TYPE_COLOR,
                                              color_expr, "name");
  ```
  
  when evaluated with `this` being a [gtk.list_item.ListItem], it will obtain the
  "item" property from the [gtk.list_item.ListItem], and then obtain the "name" property
  from the resulting object (which is assumed to be of type `GTK_TYPE_COLOR`).
  
  A more concise way to describe this would be
  
  ```
    this->item->name
  ```
  
  The most likely place where you will encounter expressions is in the context
  of list models and list widgets using them. For example, [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] is
  evaluating a [gtk.expression.Expression] to obtain strings from the items in its model
  that it can then use to match against the contents of its search entry.
  [gtk.string_filter.StringFilter] is using a [gtk.expression.Expression] for similar reasons.
  
  By default, expressions are not paying attention to changes and evaluation is
  just a snapshot of the current state at a given time. To get informed about
  changes, an expression needs to be "watched" via a [gtk.expression_watch.ExpressionWatch],
  which will cause a callback to be called whenever the value of the expression may
  have changed; [gtk.expression.Expression.watch] starts watching an expression, and
  [gtk.expression_watch.ExpressionWatch.unwatch] stops.
  
  Watches can be created for automatically updating the property of an object,
  similar to GObject's [gobject.binding.Binding] mechanism, by using [gtk.expression.Expression.bind].
  
  ## GtkExpression in GObject properties
  
  In order to use a [gtk.expression.Expression] as a [gobject.object.ObjectG] property, you must use the
  `func@Gtk.param_spec_expression` when creating a [gobject.param_spec.ParamSpec] to install in the
  [gobject.object.ObjectG] class being defined; for instance:
  
  ```c
  obj_props[PROP_EXPRESSION] =
    gtk_param_spec_expression ("expression",
                               "Expression",
                               "The expression used by the widget",
                               G_PARAM_READWRITE |
                               G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS |
                               G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY);
  ```
  
  When implementing the `GObjectClass.set_property` and `GObjectClass.get_property`
  virtual functions, you must use `func@Gtk.value_get_expression`, to retrieve the
  stored [gtk.expression.Expression] from the [gobject.value.Value] container, and `func@Gtk.value_set_expression`,
  to store the [gtk.expression.Expression] into the [gobject.value.Value]; for instance:
  
  ```c
    // in set_property()...
    case PROP_EXPRESSION:
      foo_widget_set_expression (foo, gtk_value_get_expression (value));
      break;
  
    // in get_property()...
    case PROP_EXPRESSION:
      gtk_value_set_expression (value, foo->expression);
      break;
  ```
  
  ## GtkExpression in .ui files
  
  [gtk.builder.Builder] has support for creating expressions. The syntax here can be used where
  a [gtk.expression.Expression] object is needed like in a `<property>` tag for an expression
  property, or in a `<binding name="property">` tag to bind a property to an expression.
  
  To create a property expression, use the `<lookup>` element. It can have a `type`
  attribute to specify the object type, and a `name` attribute to specify the property
  to look up. The content of `<lookup>` can either be an element specifying the expression
  to use the object, or a string that specifies the name of the object to use.
  
  Example:
  
  ```xml
    <lookup name='search'>string_filter</lookup>
  ```
  
  Since the `<lookup>` element creates an expression and its element content can
  itself be an expression, this means that `<lookup>` tags can also be nested.
  This is a common idiom when dealing with [gtk.list_item.ListItem]s. See
  [gtk.builder_list_item_factory.BuilderListItemFactory] for an example of this technique.
  
  To create a constant expression, use the `<constant>` element. If the type attribute
  is specified, the element content is interpreted as a value of that type. Otherwise,
  it is assumed to be an object. For instance:
  
  ```xml
    <constant>string_filter</constant>
    <constant type='gchararray'>Hello, world</constant>
  ```
  
  To create a closure expression, use the `<closure>` element. The `function`
  attribute specifies what function to use for the closure, and the `type`
  attribute specifies its return type. The content of the element contains the
  expressions for the parameters. For instance:
  
  ```xml
    <closure type='gchararray' function='combine_args_somehow'>
      <constant type='gchararray'>File size:</constant>
      <lookup type='GFile' name='size'>myfile</lookup>
    </closure>
  ```
  
  To create a property binding, use the `<binding>` element in place of where a
  `<property>` tag would ordinarily be used. The `name` and `object` attributes are
  supported. The `name` attribute is required, and pertains to the applicable property
  name. The `object` attribute is optional. If provided, it will use the specified object
  as the `this` object when the expression is evaluated. Here is an example in which the
  `label` property of a [gtk.label.Label] is bound to the `string` property of another arbitrary
  object:
  
  ```xml
    <object class='GtkLabel'>
      <binding name='label'>
        <lookup name='string'>some_other_object</lookup>
      </binding>
    </object>
  ```

    * Shortcuts: can be provided by the application. For example, a Paint
      program may want to add a shortcut for a Clipart folder. Shortcuts
      cannot be modified by the user.
    
    * Volumes: are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
      the “roots” of the filesystem.
  )
    
  # File Names and Encodings
  
  When the user is finished selecting files in a [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser], your
  program can get the selected filenames as [gio.file.File]s.
  
  # Adding options
  
  You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
  that are not present in the default design, by using
  [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.addChoice]. Each choice has an identifier and
  a user visible label; additionally, each choice can have multiple
  options. If a choice has no option, it will be rendered as a
  check button with the given label; if a choice has options, it will
  be rendered as a combo box.

  own. Instead, you should use the functions that work on a
  [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser].
  
  If you want to integrate well with the platform you should use the
  [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] API, which will use a platform-specific
  dialog if available and fall back to [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog]
  otherwise.
  
  ## Typical usage
  
  In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
  [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] to select a file for opening:
  
  ```c
  static void
  on_open_response (GtkDialog *dialog,
                    int        response)
  {
    if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
      {
        GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
  
        g_autoptr(GFile) file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);
  
        open_file (file);
      }
  
    gtk_window_destroy (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
  }
  
    // ...
    GtkWidget *dialog;
    GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
  
    dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                          parent_window,
                                          action,
                                          _("_Cancel"),
                                          GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                          _("_Open"),
                                          GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                          NULL);
  
    gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
  
    g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                      G_CALLBACK (on_open_response),
                      NULL);
  ```
  
  To use a dialog for saving, you can use this:
  
  ```c
  static void
  on_save_response (GtkDialog *dialog,
                    int        response)
  {
    if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
      {
        GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
  
        g_autoptr(GFile) file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);
  
        save_to_file (file);
      }
  
    gtk_window_destroy (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
  }
  
    // ...
    GtkWidget *dialog;
    GtkFileChooser *chooser;
    GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
  
    dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Save File",
                                          parent_window,
                                          action,
                                          _("_Cancel"),
                                          GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                          _("_Save"),
                                          GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                          NULL);
    chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (dialog);
  
    if (user_edited_a_new_document)
      gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, _("Untitled document"));
    else
      gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_filename);
  
    gtk_window_present (GTK_WINDOW (dialog));
  
    g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                      G_CALLBACK (on_save_response),
                      NULL);
  ```
  
  ## Setting up a file chooser dialog
  
  There are various cases in which you may need to use a [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog]:
  
  $(LIST
    * To select a file for opening, use [gtk.types.FileChooserAction.Open].
    
    * To save a file for the first time, use [gtk.types.FileChooserAction.Save],
      and suggest a name such as “Untitled” with
      [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setCurrentName].
    
    * To save a file under a different name, use [gtk.types.FileChooserAction.Save],
      and set the existing file with [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setFile].
    
    * To choose a folder instead of a filem use [gtk.types.FileChooserAction.SelectFolder].
  )
    
  In general, you should only cause the file chooser to show a specific
  folder when it is appropriate to use [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.setFile],
  i.e. when you are doing a “Save As” command and you already have a file
  saved somewhere.
  
  ## Response Codes
  
  [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] inherits from [gtk.dialog.Dialog], so buttons that
  go in its action area have response codes such as [gtk.types.ResponseType.Accept] and
  [gtk.types.ResponseType.Cancel]. For example, you could call
  [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog.new_] as follows:
  
  ```c
  GtkWidget *dialog;
  GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
  
  dialog = gtk_file_chooser_dialog_new ("Open File",
                                        parent_window,
                                        action,
                                        _("_Cancel"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_CANCEL,
                                        _("_Open"),
                                        GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT,
                                        NULL);
  ```
  
  This will create buttons for “Cancel” and “Open” that use predefined
  response identifiers from [gtk.types.ResponseType].  For most dialog
  boxes you can use your own custom response codes rather than the
  ones in [gtk.types.ResponseType], but [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] assumes that
  its “accept”-type action, e.g. an “Open” or “Save” button,
  will have one of the following response codes:
  
  $(LIST
    * [gtk.types.ResponseType.Accept]
    * [gtk.types.ResponseType.Ok]
    * [gtk.types.ResponseType.Yes]
    * [gtk.types.ResponseType.Apply]
  )
    
  This is because [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] must intercept responses and switch
  to folders if appropriate, rather than letting the dialog terminate — the
  implementation uses these known response codes to know which responses can
  be blocked if appropriate.
  
  To summarize, make sure you use a predefined response code
  when you use [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] to ensure proper operation.
  
  ## CSS nodes
  
  [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] has a single CSS node with the name `window` and style
  class `.filechooser`.

  Deprecated:     Use [gtk.file_dialog.FileDialog] instead
*/
struct GtkFileChooserDialog;

/**
    [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] is an abstraction of a dialog suitable
  for use with “File Open” or “File Save as” commands.
  
  By default, this just uses a [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] to implement
  the actual dialog. However, on some platforms, such as Windows and
  macOS, the native platform file chooser is used instead. When the
  application is running in a sandboxed environment without direct
  filesystem access (such as Flatpak), [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] may call
  the proper APIs (portals) to let the user choose a file and make it
  available to the application.
  
  While the API of [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] closely mirrors [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog],
  the main difference is that there is no access to any [gtk.window.Window] or [gtk.widget.Widget]
  for the dialog. This is required, as there may not be one in the case of a
  platform native dialog.
  
  Showing, hiding and running the dialog is handled by the
  [gtk.native_dialog.NativeDialog] functions.
  
  Note that unlike [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog], [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] objects
  are not toplevel widgets, and GTK does not keep them alive. It is your
  responsibility to keep a reference until you are done with the
  object.
  
  ## Typical usage
  
  In the simplest of cases, you can the following code to use
  [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] to select a file for opening:
  
  ```c
  static void
  on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
               int              response)
  {
    if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
      {
        GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
        GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);
  
        open_file (file);
  
        g_object_unref (file);
      }
  
    g_object_unref (native);
  }
  
    // ...
    GtkFileChooserNative *native;
    GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_OPEN;
  
    native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Open File",
                                          parent_window,
                                          action,
                                          "_Open",
                                          "_Cancel");
  
    g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
    gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
  ```
  
  To use a [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] for saving, you can use this:
  
  ```c
  static void
  on_response (GtkNativeDialog *native,
               int              response)
  {
    if (response == GTK_RESPONSE_ACCEPT)
      {
        GtkFileChooser *chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
        GFile *file = gtk_file_chooser_get_file (chooser);
  
        save_to_file (file);
  
        g_object_unref (file);
      }
  
    g_object_unref (native);
  }
  
    // ...
    GtkFileChooserNative *native;
    GtkFileChooser *chooser;
    GtkFileChooserAction action = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER_ACTION_SAVE;
  
    native = gtk_file_chooser_native_new ("Save File",
                                          parent_window,
                                          action,
                                          "_Save",
                                          "_Cancel");
    chooser = GTK_FILE_CHOOSER (native);
  
    if (user_edited_a_new_document)
      gtk_file_chooser_set_current_name (chooser, _("Untitled document"));
    else
      gtk_file_chooser_set_file (chooser, existing_file, NULL);
  
    g_signal_connect (native, "response", G_CALLBACK (on_response), NULL);
    gtk_native_dialog_show (GTK_NATIVE_DIALOG (native));
  ```
  
  For more information on how to best set up a file dialog,
  see the [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog] documentation.
  
  ## Response Codes
  
  [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative] inherits from [gtk.native_dialog.NativeDialog],
  which means it will return [gtk.types.ResponseType.Accept] if the user accepted,
  and [gtk.types.ResponseType.Cancel] if he pressed cancel. It can also return
  [gtk.types.ResponseType.DeleteEvent] if the window was unexpectedly closed.
  
  ## Differences from [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog]
  
  There are a few things in the [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser] interface that
  are not possible to use with [gtk.file_chooser_native.FileChooserNative], as such use would
  prohibit the use of a native dialog.
  
  No operations that change the dialog work while the dialog is visible.
  Set all the properties that are required before showing the dialog.
  
  ## Win32 details
  
  On windows the `IFileDialog` implementation (added in Windows Vista) is
  used. It supports many of the features that [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser] has, but
  there are some things it does not handle:
  
  $(LIST
    * Any [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter] added using a mimetype
  )
    
  If any of these features are used the regular [gtk.file_chooser_dialog.FileChooserDialog]
  will be used in place of the native one.
  
  ## Portal details
  
  When the `org.freedesktop.portal.FileChooser` portal is available on
  the session bus, it is used to bring up an out-of-process file chooser.
  Depending on the kind of session the application is running in, this may
  or may not be a GTK file chooser.
  
  ## macOS details
  
  On macOS the `NSSavePanel` and `NSOpenPanel` classes are used to provide
  native file chooser dialogs. Some features provided by [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser]
  are not supported:
  
  $(LIST
    * Shortcut folders.

    [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter] filters files by name or mime type.
  
  [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter] can be used to restrict the files being shown in a
  [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser]. Files can be filtered based on their name (with
  [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter.addPattern] or [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter.addSuffix])
  or on their mime type (with [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter.addMimeType]).
  
  Filtering by mime types handles aliasing and subclassing of mime
  types; e.g. a filter for text/plain also matches a file with mime
  type application/rtf, since application/rtf is a subclass of
  text/plain. Note that [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter] allows wildcards for the
  subtype of a mime type, so you can e.g. filter for image/\*.
  
  Normally, file filters are used by adding them to a [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser]
  (see [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser.addFilter]), but it is also possible to
  manually use a file filter on any [gtk.filter_list_model.FilterListModel] containing
  [gio.file_info.FileInfo] objects.
  
  # GtkFileFilter as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface
  supports adding rules using the `<mime-types>` and `<patterns>` and
  `<suffixes>` elements and listing the rules within. Specifying a
  `<mime-type>` or `<pattern>` or `<suffix>` has the same effect as
  as calling
  [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter.addMimeType] or
  [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter.addPattern] or
  [gtk.file_filter.FileFilter.addSuffix].

    [gtk.fixed.Fixed] places its child widgets at fixed positions and with fixed sizes.
  
  [gtk.fixed.Fixed] performs no automatic layout management.
  
  For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
  you from having to learn about the other GTK containers, but it
  results in broken applications.  With [gtk.fixed.Fixed], the following
  things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
  other display bugs:
  
  $(LIST
    * Themes, which may change widget sizes.
    
    * Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
      change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that

    * Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
      display of non-English text will use a different font in many
      cases.
  )
    
  In addition, [gtk.fixed.Fixed] does not pay attention to text direction and

  do that with [gtk.fixed.Fixed]. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on
  the text direction, you would need to manually detect it and adjust child
  positions accordingly.
  
  Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
  UI elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This
  is a long-term maintenance problem for your application.
  
  If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,

    [gtk.glarea.GLArea] is a widget that allows drawing with OpenGL.
  
  ![An example GtkGLArea](glarea.png)
  
  [gtk.glarea.GLArea] sets up its own [gdk.glcontext.GLContext], and creates a custom
  GL framebuffer that the widget will do GL rendering onto. It also ensures
  that this framebuffer is the default GL rendering target when rendering.
  The completed rendering is integrated into the larger GTK scene graph as
  a texture.
  
  In order to draw, you have to connect to the [gtk.glarea.GLArea.render]
  signal, or subclass [gtk.glarea.GLArea] and override the GtkGLAreaClass.render
  virtual function.
  
  The [gtk.glarea.GLArea] widget ensures that the [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] is associated with
  the widget's drawing area, and it is kept updated when the size and
  position of the drawing area changes.
  
  ## Drawing with GtkGLArea
  
  The simplest way to draw using OpenGL commands in a [gtk.glarea.GLArea] is to
  create a widget instance and connect to the [gtk.glarea.GLArea.render] signal:
  
  The `render()` function will be called when the [gtk.glarea.GLArea] is ready
  for you to draw its content:
  
  The initial contents of the framebuffer are transparent.
  
  ```c
  static gboolean
  render (GtkGLArea *area, GdkGLContext *context)
  {
    // inside this function it's safe to use GL; the given
    // GdkGLContext has been made current to the drawable
    // surface used by the `GtkGLArea` and the viewport has
    // already been set to be the size of the allocation
  
    // we can start by clearing the buffer
    glClearColor (0, 0, 0, 0);
    glClear (GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
  
    // draw your object
    // draw_an_object ();
  
    // we completed our drawing; the draw commands will be
    // flushed at the end of the signal emission chain, and
    // the buffers will be drawn on the window
    return TRUE;
  }
  
  void setup_glarea (void)
  {
    // create a GtkGLArea instance
    GtkWidget *gl_area = gtk_gl_area_new ();
  
    // connect to the "render" signal
    g_signal_connect (gl_area, "render", G_CALLBACK (render), NULL);
  }
  ```
  
  If you need to initialize OpenGL state, e.g. buffer objects or
  shaders, you should use the [gtk.widget.Widget.realize] signal;
  you can use the [gtk.widget.Widget.unrealize] signal to clean up.
  Since the [gdk.glcontext.GLContext] creation and initialization may fail, you
  will need to check for errors, using [gtk.glarea.GLArea.getError].
  
  An example of how to safely initialize the GL state is:
  
  ```c
  static void
  on_realize (GtkGLarea *area)
  {
    // We need to make the context current if we want to
    // call GL API
    gtk_gl_area_make_current (area);
  
    // If there were errors during the initialization or
    // when trying to make the context current, this
    // function will return a GError for you to catch
    if (gtk_gl_area_get_error (area) != NULL)
      return;
  
    // You can also use gtk_gl_area_set_error() in order
    // to show eventual initialization errors on the
    // GtkGLArea widget itself
    GError *internal_error = NULL;
    init_buffer_objects (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }
  
    init_shaders (&error);
    if (error != NULL)
      {
        gtk_gl_area_set_error (area, error);
        g_error_free (error);
        return;
      }
  }
  ```
  
  If you need to change the options for creating the [gdk.glcontext.GLContext]
  you should use the `signal@Gtk.GLArea::create-context` signal.

    [gtk.gesture.Gesture] is the base class for gesture recognition.
  
  Although [gtk.gesture.Gesture] is quite generalized to serve as a base for
  multi-touch gestures, it is suitable to implement single-touch and
  pointer-based gestures (using the special null [gdk.event_sequence.EventSequence]
  value for these).
  
  The number of touches that a [gtk.gesture.Gesture] need to be recognized is
  controlled by the `property@Gtk.Gesture:n-points` property, if a
  gesture is keeping track of less or more than that number of sequences,
  it won't check whether the gesture is recognized.
  
  As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, it will check
  regularly if it is recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as
  "recognized" is left to [gtk.gesture.Gesture] subclasses.
  
  A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
  
  $(LIST
    * [gtk.gesture.Gesture.begin] when the gesture is recognized.
    * [gtk.gesture.Gesture.update], whenever an input event is processed.
    * [gtk.gesture.Gesture.end] when the gesture is no longer recognized.
  )
    
  ## Event propagation
  
  In order to receive events, a gesture needs to set a propagation phase
  through [gtk.event_controller.EventController.setPropagationPhase].
  
  In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down
  to the target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers
  above the widget get a chance to interact with the event before it
  reaches the target.
  
  In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget
  to the toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above
  the widget get a chance to interact with events that have not been
  handled yet.
  
  ## States of a sequence
  
  Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade
  of [gtk.gesture.Gesture]s, both across the parents of the widget receiving the
  event and in parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility
  of the widgets using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences
  accordingly in order to enable cooperation of gestures around the
  [gdk.event_sequence.EventSequence]s triggering those.
  
  Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through [gtk.gesture.Gesture.group].
  Grouped gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
  [gtk.gesture.Gesture.setState] on one will effectively propagate
  the state throughout the group.
  
  By default, all sequences start out in the [gtk.types.EventSequenceState.None] state,
  sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
  propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
  
  If a sequence enters into the [gtk.types.EventSequenceState.Denied] state, the gesture
  group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
  through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while
  the touch is active.
  
  If a sequence enters in the [gtk.types.EventSequenceState.Claimed] state, the gesture
  group will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
  
  $(LIST
    * Setting the same sequence to [gtk.types.EventSequenceState.Denied] on every other
      gesture group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets
      in the propagation chain.
    * Emitting [gtk.gesture.Gesture.cancel] on every gesture in widgets
      underneath in the propagation chain.
    * Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
  )
    
  Note: if a sequence is set early to [gtk.types.EventSequenceState.Claimed] on
  [gdk.types.EventType.TouchBegin]/[gdk.types.EventType.ButtonPress] (so those events are captured before
  reaching the event widget, this implies [gtk.types.PropagationPhase.Capture]), one similar
  event will be emulated if the sequence changes to [gtk.types.EventSequenceState.Denied].
  This way event coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped
  again.
  
  Sequence states can't be changed freely.
  See [gtk.gesture.Gesture.setState] to know about the possible
  lifetimes of a [gdk.event_sequence.EventSequence].
  
  ## Touchpad gestures
  
  On the platforms that support it, [gtk.gesture.Gesture] will handle transparently
  touchpad gesture events. The only precautions users of [gtk.gesture.Gesture] should
  do to enable this support are:
  
  $(LIST
    * If the gesture has [gtk.types.PropagationPhase.None], ensuring events of type
      [gdk.types.EventType.TouchpadSwipe] and [gdk.types.EventType.TouchpadPinch] are handled by the [gtk.gesture.Gesture]

  Graphics offload is an optimization to reduce overhead and battery use that is

  situations. GTK will automatically fall back to normal rendering if it doesn't.
  
  Graphics offload is most efficient if there are no controls drawn on top of the
  video content.
  
  You should consider using graphics offload for your main widget if it shows
  frequently changing content (such as a video, or a VM display) and you provide
  the content in the form of dmabuf textures (see [gdk.dmabuf_texture_builder.DmabufTextureBuilder]),
  in particular if it may be fullscreen.
  
  Numerous factors can prohibit graphics offload:
  
  $(LIST
    * Unsupported platforms. Currently, graphics offload only works on Linux with Wayland.
    
    * Clipping, such as rounded corners that cause the video content to not be rectangular

    * Filters such as opacity, grayscale or similar
  )
    
  To investigate problems related graphics offload, GTK offers debug flags to print
  out information about graphics offload and dmabuf use:

      GDK_DEBUG=dmabuf

    [gtk.grid_view.GridView] presents a large dynamic grid of items.
  
  [gtk.grid_view.GridView] uses its factory to generate one child widget for each
  visible item and shows them in a grid. The orientation of the grid view
  determines if the grid reflows vertically or horizontally.
  
  [gtk.grid_view.GridView] allows the user to select items according to the selection
  characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
  it is possible to turn on _rubberband selection_, using
  `property@Gtk.GridView:enable-rubberband`.

    [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar] is a widget for creating custom title bars for windows.
  
  ![An example GtkHeaderBar](headerbar.png)
  
  [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar] is similar to a horizontal [gtk.center_box.CenterBox]. It allows
  children to be placed at the start or the end. In addition, it allows
  the window title to be displayed. The title will be centered with respect
  to the width of the box, even if the children at either side take up
  different amounts of space.
  
  [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar] can add typical window frame controls, such as minimize,
  maximize and close buttons, or the window icon.
  
  For these reasons, [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar] is the natural choice for use as the
  custom titlebar widget of a [gtk.window.Window] (see [gtk.window.Window.setTitlebar]),
  as it gives features typical of titlebars while allowing the addition of
  child widgets.
  
  ## GtkHeaderBar as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface supports
  adding children at the start or end sides by specifying “start” or “end” as
  the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element, or setting the title widget by
  specifying “title” value.
  
  By default the [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar] uses a [gtk.label.Label] displaying the title of the
  window it is contained in as the title widget, equivalent to the following
  UI definition:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkHeaderBar">
    <property name="title-widget">
      <object class="GtkLabel">
        <property name="label" translatable="yes">Label</property>
        <property name="single-line-mode">True</property>
        <property name="ellipsize">end</property>
        <property name="width-chars">5</property>
        <style>
          <class name="title"/>
        </style>
      </object>

  A [gtk.header_bar.HeaderBar]'s CSS node is called `headerbar`. It contains a `windowhandle`
  subnode, which contains a `box` subnode, which contains two `box` subnodes at
  the start and end of the header bar, as well as a center node that represents
  the title.
  
  Each of the boxes contains a `windowcontrols` subnode, see

    [gtk.imcontext.IMContext] defines the interface for GTK input methods.
  
  [gtk.imcontext.IMContext] is used by GTK text input widgets like [gtk.text.Text]
  to map from key events to Unicode character strings.
  
  An input method may consume multiple key events in sequence before finally
  outputting the composed result. This is called *preediting*, and an input
  method may provide feedback about this process by displaying the intermediate
  composition states as preedit text. To do so, the [gtk.imcontext.IMContext] will emit
  `signal@Gtk.IMContext::preedit-start`, `signal@Gtk.IMContext::preedit-changed`
  and `signal@Gtk.IMContext::preedit-end` signals.
  
  For instance, the built-in GTK input method [gtk.imcontext_simple.IMContextSimple]
  implements the input of arbitrary Unicode code points by holding down the
  <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys and then typing <kbd>u</kbd>
  followed by the hexadecimal digits of the code point. When releasing the
  <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys, preediting ends and the
  character is inserted as text. For example,
  
      Ctrl+Shift+u 2 0 A C
  
  results in the € sign.
  
  Additional input methods can be made available for use by GTK widgets as
  loadable modules. An input method module is a small shared library which
  provides a [gio.ioextension.IOExtension] for the extension point named "gtk-im-module".
  
  To connect a widget to the users preferred input method, you should use
  [gtk.immulticontext.IMMulticontext].

  ## Compose sequences
  
  [gtk.imcontext_simple.IMContextSimple] reads compose sequences from the first of the
  following files that is found: ~/.config/gtk-4.0/Compose, ~/.XCompose,
  /usr/share/X11/locale/$locale/Compose (for locales that have a nontrivial
  Compose file). A subset of the file syntax described in the Compose(5)
  manual page is supported. Additionally, `include "`L`"` loads GTK’s built-in
  table of compose sequences rather than the locale-specific one from X11.
  
  If none of these files is found, [gtk.imcontext_simple.IMContextSimple] uses a built-in table
  of compose sequences that is derived from the X11 Compose files.
  
  Note that compose sequences typically start with the Compose_key, which is
  often not available as a dedicated key on keyboards. Keyboard layouts may
  map this keysym to other keys, such as the right Control key.
  
  ## Unicode characters
  
  [gtk.imcontext_simple.IMContextSimple] also supports numeric entry of Unicode characters
  by typing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>u</kbd>, followed by a
  hexadecimal Unicode codepoint.
  
  For example,
  
      Ctrl-Shift-u 1 2 3 Enter
  
  yields U+0123 LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH CEDILLA, i.e. ģ.
  
  ## Dead keys
  
  [gtk.imcontext_simple.IMContextSimple] supports dead keys. For example, typing
  
      dead_acute a
  
   yields U+00E! LATIN SMALL LETTER_A WITH ACUTE, i.e. á. Note that this
   depends on the keyboard layout including dead keys.

  follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
  There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications

  If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the image will contain a

  If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
  for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
  [gdk.texture.Texture.newFromFile], then create the [gtk.image.Image] with
  [gtk.image.Image.newFromPaintable].
  
  Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data

  # GtkInfoBar as GtkBuildable
  
  [gtk.info_bar.InfoBar] supports a custom `<action-widgets>` element, which can contain
  multiple `<action-widget>` elements. The “response” attribute specifies a
  numeric response, and the content of the element is the id of widget
  (which should be a child of the dialogs @action_area).
  
  [gtk.info_bar.InfoBar] supports adding action widgets by specifying “action” as
  the “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. The widget will be added
  either to the action area. The response id has to be associated
  with the action widget using the `<action-widgets>` element.
  
  # CSS nodes
  
  [gtk.info_bar.InfoBar] has a single CSS node with name infobar. The node may get
  one of the style classes .info, .warning, .error or .question, depending
  on the message type.
  If the info bar shows a close button, that button will have the .close
  style class applied.

  Deprecated:     There is no replacement in GTK for an "info bar" widget;
      you can use [gtk.revealer.Revealer] with a [gtk.box.Box] containing a
      [gtk.label.Label] and an optional [gtk.button.Button], according to
      your application's design.

  As the name implies, most labels are used to label another widget

  ![An example GtkLabel](label.png)
  
  ## CSS nodes
  
  ```
  label
  ├── [selection]
  ├── [link]
  ┊
  ╰── [link]
  ```
  
  [gtk.label.Label] has a single CSS node with the name label. A wide variety
  of style classes may be applied to labels, such as .title, .subtitle,
  .dim-label, etc. In the [gtk.shortcuts_window.ShortcutsWindow], labels are used with the
  .keycap style class.
  
  If the label has a selection, it gets a subnode with name selection.
  
  If the label has links, there is one subnode per link. These subnodes
  carry the link or visited state depending on whether they have been
  visited. In this case, label node also gets a .link style class.
  
  ## GtkLabel as GtkBuildable
  
  The GtkLabel implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
  custom `<attributes>` element, which supports any number of `<attribute>`
  elements. The `<attribute>` element has attributes named “name“, “value“,
  “start“ and “end“ and allows you to specify [pango.attribute.Attribute]
  values for this label.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment specifying Pango attributes:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkLabel">
    <attributes>
      <attribute name="weight" value="PANGO_WEIGHT_BOLD"/>
      <attribute name="background" value="red" start="5" end="10"/>
    </attributes>
  </object>
  ```
  
  The start and end attributes specify the range of characters to which the
  Pango attribute applies. If start and end are not specified, the attribute is
  applied to the whole text. Note that specifying ranges does not make much
  sense with translatable attributes. Use markup embedded in the translatable
  content instead.
  
  ## Accessibility
  
  [gtk.label.Label] uses the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.Label] role.
  
  ## Mnemonics
  
  Labels may contain “mnemonics”. Mnemonics are underlined characters in the
  label, used for keyboard navigation. Mnemonics are created by providing a
  string with an underscore before the mnemonic character, such as `"_File"`,
  to the functions [gtk.label.Label.newWithMnemonic] or
  [gtk.label.Label.setTextWithMnemonic].
  
  Mnemonics automatically activate any activatable widget the label is
  inside, such as a [gtk.button.Button]; if the label is not inside the
  mnemonic’s target widget, you have to tell the label about the target
  using [gtk.label.Label.setMnemonicWidget].
  
  Here’s a simple example where the label is inside a button:
  
  ```c
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new ();
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_button_set_child (GTK_BUTTON (button), label);
  ```
  
  There’s a convenience function to create buttons with a mnemonic label
  already inside:
  
  ```c
  // Pressing Alt+H will activate this button
  GtkWidget *button = gtk_button_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  ```
  
  To create a mnemonic for a widget alongside the label, such as a
  [gtk.entry.Entry], you have to point the label at the entry with
  [gtk.label.Label.setMnemonicWidget]:
  
  ```c
  // Pressing Alt+H will focus the entry
  GtkWidget *entry = gtk_entry_new ();
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new_with_mnemonic ("_Hello");
  gtk_label_set_mnemonic_widget (GTK_LABEL (label), entry);
  ```
  
  ## Markup (styled text)
  
  To make it easy to format text in a label (changing colors,
  fonts, etc.), label text can be provided in a simple
  markup format:
  
  Here’s how to create a label with a small font:
  ```c
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
  gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), "<small>Small text</small>");
  ```
  
  (See the Pango manual for complete documentation] of available
  tags, `func@Pango.parse_markup`)
  
  The markup passed to [gtk.label.Label.setMarkup] must be valid; for example,
  literal `<`, `>` and `&` characters must be escaped as `&lt;`, `&gt;`, and `&amp;`.
  If you pass text obtained from the user, file, or a network to
  [gtk.label.Label.setMarkup], you’ll want to escape it with
  `func@GLib.markup_escape_text` or `func@GLib.markup_printf_escaped`.
  
  Markup strings are just a convenient way to set the [pango.attr_list.AttrList]
  on a label; [gtk.label.Label.setAttributes] may be a simpler way to set
  attributes in some cases. Be careful though; [pango.attr_list.AttrList] tends
  to cause internationalization problems, unless you’re applying attributes
  to the entire string (i.e. unless you set the range of each attribute
  to [0, `G_MAXINT`)). The reason is that specifying the start_index and
  end_index for a [pango.attribute.Attribute] requires knowledge of the exact
  string being displayed, so translations will cause problems.
  
  ## Selectable labels
  
  Labels can be made selectable with [gtk.label.Label.setSelectable].
  Selectable labels allow the user to copy the label contents to
  the clipboard. Only labels that contain useful-to-copy information—such
  as error messages—should be made selectable.
  
  ## Text layout
  
  A label can contain any number of paragraphs, but will have
  performance problems if it contains more than a small number.
  Paragraphs are separated by newlines or other paragraph separators
  understood by Pango.
  
  Labels can automatically wrap text if you call [gtk.label.Label.setWrap].
  
  [gtk.label.Label.setJustify] sets how the lines in a label align
  with one another. If you want to set how the label as a whole aligns
  in its available space, see the [gtk.widget.Widget.Align] and
  [gtk.widget.Widget.Align] properties.
  
  The `property@Gtk.Label:width-chars` and `property@Gtk.Label:max-width-chars`
  properties can be used to control the size allocation of ellipsized or
  wrapped labels. For ellipsizing labels, if either is specified (and less
  than the actual text size), it is used as the minimum width, and the actual
  text size is used as the natural width of the label. For wrapping labels,
  width-chars is used as the minimum width, if specified, and max-width-chars
  is used as the natural width. Even if max-width-chars specified, wrapping
  labels will be rewrapped to use all of the available width.
  
  ## Links
  
  GTK supports markup for clickable hyperlinks in addition to regular Pango
  markup. The markup for links is borrowed from HTML, using the `<a>` with
  “href“, “title“ and “class“ attributes. GTK renders links similar to the
  way they appear in web browsers, with colored, underlined text. The “title“
  attribute is displayed as a tooltip on the link. The “class“ attribute is
  used as style class on the CSS node for the link.
  
  An example of inline links looks like this:
  
  ```c
  const char *text =
  "Go to the "
  "<a href=\"https://www.gtk.org\" title=\"&lt;i&gt;Our&lt;/i&gt; website\">"
  "GTK website</a> for more...";
  GtkWidget *label = gtk_label_new (NULL);
  gtk_label_set_markup (GTK_LABEL (label), text);
  ```
  
  It is possible to implement custom handling for links and their tooltips
  with the `signal@Gtk.Label::activate-link` signal and the
  [gtk.label.Label.getCurrentUri] function.

  You typically subclass [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager] if you want to implement a
  layout policy for the children of a widget, or if you want to determine
  the size of a widget depending on its contents.
  
  Each [gtk.widget.Widget] can only have a [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager] instance associated
  to it at any given time; it is possible, though, to replace the layout
  manager instance using [gtk.widget.Widget.setLayoutManager].
  
  ## Layout properties
  
  A layout manager can expose properties for controlling the layout of
  each child, by creating an object type derived from [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild]
  and installing the properties on it as normal [gobject.object.ObjectG] properties.
  
  Each [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild] instance storing the layout properties for a
  specific child is created through the [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager.getLayoutChild]
  method; a [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager] controls the creation of its [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild]
  instances by overriding the GtkLayoutManagerClass.create_layout_child()
  virtual function. The typical implementation should look like:
  
  ```c
  static GtkLayoutChild *
  create_layout_child (GtkLayoutManager *manager,
                       GtkWidget        *container,
                       GtkWidget        *child)
  {
    return g_object_new (your_layout_child_get_type (),
                         "layout-manager", manager,
                         "child-widget", child,
                         NULL);
  }
  ```
  
  The `property@Gtk.LayoutChild:layout-manager` and
  `property@Gtk.LayoutChild:child-widget` properties
  on the newly created [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild] instance are mandatory. The
  [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager] will cache the newly created [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild] instance
  until the widget is removed from its parent, or the parent removes the
  layout manager.
  
  Each [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager] instance creating a [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild] should use
  [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager.getLayoutChild] every time it needs to query
  the layout properties; each [gtk.layout_child.LayoutChild] instance should call
  [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager.layoutChanged] every time a property is
  updated, in order to queue a new size measuring and allocation.

  Typical use cases are displaying the strength of a password, or
  showing the charge level of a battery.
  
  ![An example GtkLevelBar](levelbar.png)
  
  Use [gtk.level_bar.LevelBar.setValue] to set the current value, and
  [gtk.level_bar.LevelBar.addOffsetValue] to set the value offsets at which
  the bar will be considered in a different state. GTK will add a few
  offsets by default on the level bar: `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW`,
  `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_HIGH` and `GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_FULL`, with
  values 0.25, 0.75 and 1.0 respectively.
  
  Note that it is your responsibility to update preexisting offsets
  when changing the minimum or maximum value. GTK will simply clamp
  them to the new range.
  
  ## Adding a custom offset on the bar
  
  ```c
  static GtkWidget *
  create_level_bar (void)
  {
    GtkWidget *widget;
    GtkLevelBar *bar;
  
    widget = gtk_level_bar_new ();
    bar = GTK_LEVEL_BAR (widget);
  
    // This changes the value of the default low offset
  
    gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar,
                                    GTK_LEVEL_BAR_OFFSET_LOW,
                                    0.10);
  
    // This adds a new offset to the bar; the application will
    // be able to change its color CSS like this:
    //
    // levelbar block.my-offset {
    //   background-color: magenta;
    //   border-style: solid;
    //   border-color: black;
    //   border-width: 1px;
    // }
  
    gtk_level_bar_add_offset_value (bar, "my-offset", 0.60);
  
    return widget;
  }
  ```
  
  The default interval of values is between zero and one, but it’s possible
  to modify the interval using [gtk.level_bar.LevelBar.setMinValue] and
  [gtk.level_bar.LevelBar.setMaxValue]. The value will be always drawn in
  proportion to the admissible interval, i.e. a value of 15 with a specified
  interval between 10 and 20 is equivalent to a value of 0.5 with an interval
  between 0 and 1. When [gtk.types.LevelBarMode.Discrete] is used, the bar level
  is rendered as a finite number of separated blocks instead of a single one.
  The number of blocks that will be rendered is equal to the number of units
  specified by the admissible interval.
  
  For instance, to build a bar rendered with five blocks, it’s sufficient to
  set the minimum value to 0 and the maximum value to 5 after changing the
  indicator mode to discrete.

  The [gtk.level_bar.LevelBar] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface supports a

  or .empty. In continuous mode, there is exactly one node of each, in discrete
  mode, the number of filled and unfilled nodes corresponds to blocks that are

  A view is usually only able to display anything after both a factory
  and a model have been set on the view. So it is important that you do
  not skip this step when setting up your first view.
  
  Because views do not display the whole list at once but only a few
  items, they only need to maintain a few widgets at a time. They will
  instruct the [gtk.list_item_factory.ListItemFactory] to create these widgets and bind them
  to the items that are currently displayed.
  
  As the list model changes or the user scrolls to the list, the items will
  change and the view will instruct the factory to bind the widgets to those
  new items.
  
  The actual widgets used for displaying those widgets is provided by you.
  
  When the factory needs widgets created, it will create a [gtk.list_item.ListItem]
  and hand it to your code to set up a widget for. This list item will provide
  various properties with information about what item to display and provide
  you with some opportunities to configure its behavior. See the
  [gtk.list_item.ListItem] documentation for further details.
  
  Various implementations of [gtk.list_item_factory.ListItemFactory] exist to allow you different
  ways to provide those widgets. The most common implementations are
  [gtk.builder_list_item_factory.BuilderListItemFactory] which takes a [gtk.builder.Builder] .ui file
  and then creates widgets and manages everything automatically from the
  information in that file and [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory] which allows
  you to connect to signals with your own code and retain full control over
  how the widgets are setup and managed.
  
  A [gtk.list_item_factory.ListItemFactory] is supposed to be final - that means its behavior should
  not change and the first widget created from it should behave the same way as
  the last widget created from it.
  If you intend to do changes to the behavior, it is recommended that you create
  a new [gtk.list_item_factory.ListItemFactory] which will allow the views to recreate its widgets.
  
  Once you have chosen your factory and created it, you need to set it
  on the view widget you want to use it with, such as via
  [gtk.list_view.ListView.setFactory]. Reusing factories across different
  views is allowed, but very uncommon.

/**
    A list-like data structure that can be used with the [gtk.tree_view.TreeView].
  
  The [gtk.list_store.ListStore] object is a list model for use with a [gtk.tree_view.TreeView]
  widget.  It implements the [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] interface, and consequentialy,
  can use all of the methods available there.  It also implements the
  [gtk.tree_sortable.TreeSortable] interface so it can be sorted by the view.
  Finally, it also implements the tree
  [drag](iface.TreeDragSource.html) and [drop](iface.TreeDragDest.html)
  interfaces.
  
  The [gtk.list_store.ListStore] can accept most [gobject.types.TYPE_FLAG_RESERVED_ID_BIT]s as a column type, though
  it can’t accept all custom types.  Internally, it will keep a copy of
  data passed in (such as a string or a boxed pointer).  Columns that
  accept [gobject.object.ObjectG]s are handled a little differently.  The
  [gtk.list_store.ListStore] will keep a reference to the object instead of copying the
  value.  As a result, if the object is modified, it is up to the
  application writer to call [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.rowChanged] to emit the
  `signal@Gtk.TreeModel::row_changed` signal. This most commonly affects lists
  with [gdk.texture.Texture]s stored.
  
  An example for creating a simple list store:
  
  ```c
  enum {
    COLUMN_STRING,
    COLUMN_INT,
    COLUMN_BOOLEAN,
    N_COLUMNS
  };
  
  {
    GtkListStore *list_store;
    GtkTreePath *path;
    GtkTreeIter iter;
    int i;
  
    list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                     G_TYPE_STRING,
                                     G_TYPE_INT,
                                     G_TYPE_BOOLEAN);
  
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
        char *some_data;
  
        some_data = get_some_data (i);
  
        // Add a new row to the model
        gtk_list_store_append (list_store, &iter);
        gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                            COLUMN_STRING, some_data,
                            COLUMN_INT, i,
                            COLUMN_BOOLEAN,  FALSE,
                            -1);
  
        // As the store will keep a copy of the string internally,
        // we free some_data.
        g_free (some_data);
      }
  
    // Modify a particular row
    path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("4");
    gtk_tree_model_get_iter (GTK_TREE_MODEL (list_store),
                             &iter,
                             path);
    gtk_tree_path_free (path);
    gtk_list_store_set (list_store, &iter,
                        COLUMN_BOOLEAN, TRUE,
                        -1);
  }
  ```
  
  [gtk.list_store.ListStore] is deprecated since GTK 4.10, and should not be used in newly
  written code. You should use [gio.list_store.ListStore] instead, and the various
  list models provided by GTK.
  
  ## Performance Considerations
  
  Internally, the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] was originally implemented with a linked list
  with a tail pointer.  As a result, it was fast at data insertion and deletion,
  and not fast at random data access.  The [gtk.list_store.ListStore] sets the
  [gtk.types.TreeModelFlags.ItersPersist] flag, which means that [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter]s can be
  cached while the row exists.  Thus, if access to a particular row is needed
  often and your code is expected to run on older versions of GTK, it is worth
  keeping the iter around.
  
  ## Atomic Operations
  
  It is important to note that only the methods
  [gtk.list_store.ListStore.insertWithValues] and [gtk.list_store.ListStore.insertWithValuesv]
  are atomic, in the sense that the row is being appended to the store and the
  values filled in in a single operation with regard to [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] signaling.
  In contrast, using e.g. [gtk.list_store.ListStore.append] and then [gtk.list_store.ListStore.set]
  will first create a row, which triggers the `GtkTreeModel::row-inserted` signal
  on [gtk.list_store.ListStore]. The row, however, is still empty, and any signal handler
  connecting to `GtkTreeModel::row-inserted` on this particular store should be prepared
  for the situation that the row might be empty. This is especially important
  if you are wrapping the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] inside a [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]Filter and are
  using a [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]FilterVisibleFunc. Using any of the non-atomic operations
  to append rows to the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] will cause the
  [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]FilterVisibleFunc to be visited with an empty row first; the
  function must be prepared for that.
  
  ## GtkListStore as GtkBuildable
  
  The GtkListStore implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface allows
  to specify the model columns with a `<columns>` element that may contain
  multiple `<column>` elements, each specifying one model column. The “type”
  attribute specifies the data type for the column.
  
  Additionally, it is possible to specify content for the list store
  in the UI definition, with the `<data>` element. It can contain multiple
  `<row>` elements, each specifying to content for one row of the list model.
  Inside a `<row>`, the `<col>` elements specify the content for individual cells.
  
  Note that it is probably more common to define your models in the code,
  and one might consider it a layering violation to specify the content of
  a list store in a UI definition, data, not presentation, and common wisdom
  is to separate the two, as far as possible.
  
  An example of a UI Definition fragment for a list store:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkListStore">
    <columns>
      <column type="gchararray"/>
      <column type="gchararray"/>
      <column type="gint"/>
    </columns>
    <data>
      <row>
        <col id="0">John</col>
        <col id="1">Doe</col>
        <col id="2">25</col>
      </row>
      <row>
        <col id="0">Johan</col>
        <col id="1">Dahlin</col>
        <col id="2">50</col>
      </row>
    </data>
  </object>
  ```

    [gtk.list_view.ListView] presents a large dynamic list of items.
  
  [gtk.list_view.ListView] uses its factory to generate one row widget for each visible
  item and shows them in a linear display, either vertically or horizontally.
  
  The `property@Gtk.ListView:show-separators` property offers a simple way to
  display separators between the rows.
  
  [gtk.list_view.ListView] allows the user to select items according to the selection
  characteristics of the model. For models that allow multiple selected items,
  it is possible to turn on _rubberband selection_, using
  `property@Gtk.ListView:enable-rubberband`.
  
  If you need multiple columns with headers, see [gtk.column_view.ColumnView].
  
  To learn more about the list widget framework, see the
  [overview](section-list-widget.html).

  [gtk.list_view.ListView] uses a single CSS node named `listview`. It may carry the
  `.separators` style class, when `property@Gtk.ListView:show-separators`
  property is set. Each child widget uses a single CSS node named `row`.
  If the [gtk.list_item.ListItem.gboolean] property is set, the
  corresponding row will have the `.activatable` style class. For
  rubberband selection, a node with name `rubberband` is used.
  
  The main listview node may also carry style classes to select
  the style of [list presentation](ListContainers.html#list-styles):
  .rich-list, .navigation-sidebar or .data-table.

  ![An example GtkLockButton](lock-button.png)
  
  It is typically used in preference dialogs or control panels.
  
  The required authorization is represented by a [gio.permission.Permission] object.
  Concrete implementations of [gio.permission.Permission] may use PolicyKit or some
  other authorization framework. To obtain a PolicyKit-based
  [gio.permission.Permission], use `polkit_permission_new()`.
  
  If the user is not currently allowed to perform the action, but can
  obtain the permission, the widget looks like this:
  
  ![](lockbutton-locked.png)
  
  and the user can click the button to request the permission. Depending
  on the platform, this may pop up an authentication dialog or ask the user
  to authenticate in some other way. Once the user has obtained the permission,
  the widget changes to this:

  and the permission can be dropped again by clicking the button. If the user
  is not able to obtain the permission at all, the widget looks like this:
  
  ![](lockbutton-sorry.png)
  
  If the user has the permission and cannot drop it, the button is hidden.
  
  The text (and tooltips) that are shown in the various cases can be adjusted

  The [gtk.menu_button.MenuButton] widget can show either an icon (set with the
  `property@Gtk.MenuButton:icon-name` property) or a label (set with the
  [gtk.menu_button.MenuButton.utf8] property). If neither is explicitly set,

  according to [gtk.menu_button.MenuButton.ArrowType] or the generic
  “open-menu-symbolic” icon if the direction is not set.
  
  The positioning of the popup is determined by the
  [gtk.menu_button.MenuButton.ArrowType] property of the menu button.
  
  For menus, the [gtk.widget.Widget.Align] and [gtk.widget.Widget.Align]
  properties of the menu are also taken into account. For example, when the
  direction is [gtk.types.ArrowType.Down] and the horizontal alignment is [gtk.types.Align.Start],

  edge of the button. If there is not enough space below the button, the
  menu is popped up above the button instead. If the alignment would move
  part of the menu offscreen, it is “pushed in”.

  [gtk.menu_button.MenuButton] has a single CSS node with name `menubutton`

  If the button contains an icon, it will have the `.image-button` style class,
  if it contains text, it will have `.text-button` style class. If an arrow is
  visible in addition to an icon, text or a custom child, it will also have
  `.arrow-button` style class.
  
  Inside the toggle button content, there is an `arrow` node for
  the indicator, which will carry one of the `.none`, `.up`, `.down`,
  `.left` or `.right` style classes to indicate the direction that
  the menu will appear in. The CSS is expected to provide a suitable
  image for each of these cases using the `-gtk-icon-source` property.
  
  Optionally, the `menubutton` node can carry the `.circular` style class
  to request a round appearance.

    [gtk.message_dialog.MessageDialog] presents a dialog with some message text.
  
  ![An example GtkMessageDialog](messagedialog.png)
  
  It’s simply a convenience widget; you could construct the equivalent of
  [gtk.message_dialog.MessageDialog] from [gtk.dialog.Dialog] without too much effort, but
  [gtk.message_dialog.MessageDialog] saves typing.
  
  The easiest way to do a modal message dialog is to use the [gtk.types.DialogFlags.Modal]
  flag, which will call [gtk.window.Window.setModal] internally. The dialog will
  prevent interaction with the parent window until it's hidden or destroyed.
  You can use the [gtk.dialog.Dialog.response] signal to know when the user
  dismissed the dialog.
  
  An example for using a modal dialog:
  ```c
  GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT | GTK_DIALOG_MODAL;
  dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                   flags,
                                   GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                   GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                   "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                   filename,
                                   g_strerror (errno));
  // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it
  // (e.g. clicks a button)
  
  g_signal_connect (dialog, "response",
                    G_CALLBACK (gtk_window_destroy),
                    NULL);
  ```
  
  You might do a non-modal [gtk.message_dialog.MessageDialog] simply by omitting the
  [gtk.types.DialogFlags.Modal] flag:
  
  ```c
  GtkDialogFlags flags = GTK_DIALOG_DESTROY_WITH_PARENT;
  dialog = gtk_message_dialog_new (parent_window,
                                   flags,
                                   GTK_MESSAGE_ERROR,
                                   GTK_BUTTONS_CLOSE,
                                   "Error reading “%s”: %s",
                                   filename,
                                   g_strerror (errno));
  
  // Destroy the dialog when the user responds to it

    [gtk.notebook.Notebook] is a container whose children are pages switched

  ![An example GtkNotebook](notebook.png)
  
  There are many configuration options for [gtk.notebook.Notebook]. Among
  other things, you can choose on which edge the tabs appear
  (see [gtk.notebook.Notebook.setTabPos]), whether, if there are
  too many tabs to fit the notebook should be made bigger or scrolling

  # GtkNotebook as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.notebook.Notebook] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface
  supports placing children into tabs by specifying “tab” as the
  “type” attribute of a `<child>` element. Note that the content
  of the tab must be created before the tab can be filled.
  A tab child can be specified without specifying a `<child>`
  type attribute.
  
  To add a child widget in the notebooks action area, specify
  "action-start" or “action-end” as the “type” attribute of the
  `<child>` element.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment with [gtk.notebook.Notebook]:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkNotebook">
    <child>
      <object class="GtkLabel" id="notebook-content">
        <property name="label">Content</property>
      </object>
    </child>
    <child type="tab">
      <object class="GtkLabel" id="notebook-tab">
        <property name="label">Tab</property>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>

  [gtk.notebook.Notebook] has a main CSS node with name `notebook`, a subnode
  with name `header` and below that a subnode with name `tabs` which
  contains one subnode per tab with name `tab`.
  
  If action widgets are present, their CSS nodes are placed next
  to the `tabs` node. If the notebook is scrollable, CSS nodes with
  name `arrow` are placed as first and last child of the `tabs` node.
  
  The main node gets the `.frame` style class when the notebook
  has a border (see [gtk.notebook.Notebook.setShowBorder]).
  
  The header node gets one of the style class `.top`, `.bottom`,
  `.left` or `.right`, depending on where the tabs are placed. For
  reorderable pages, the tab node gets the `.reorderable-page` class.
  
  A `tab` node gets the `.dnd` style class while it is moved with drag-and-drop.
  
  The nodes are always arranged from left-to-right, regardless of text direction.

    [gtk.pad_controller.PadController] is an event controller for the pads found in drawing
  tablets.
  
  Pads are the collection of buttons and tactile sensors often found around
  the stylus-sensitive area.
  
  These buttons and sensors have no implicit meaning, and by default they
  perform no action. [gtk.pad_controller.PadController] is provided to map those to
  [gio.action.Action] objects, thus letting the application give them a more
  semantic meaning.
  
  Buttons and sensors are not constrained to triggering a single action,
  some [gdk.types.InputSource.TabletPad] devices feature multiple "modes". All these
  input elements have one current mode, which may determine the final action
  being triggered.
  
  Pad devices often divide buttons and sensors into groups. All elements
  in a group share the same current mode, but different groups may have
  different modes. See [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getNGroups] and
  [gdk.device_pad.DevicePad.getGroupNModes].
  
  Each of the actions that a given button/strip/ring performs for a given mode
  is defined by a [gtk.pad_action_entry.PadActionEntry]. It contains an action name that
  will be looked up in the given [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] and activated whenever
  the specified input element and mode are triggered.
  
  A simple example of [gtk.pad_controller.PadController] usage: Assigning button 1 in all
  modes and pad devices to an "invert-selection" action:
  
  ```c
  GtkPadActionEntry *pad_actions[] = {
    { GTK_PAD_ACTION_BUTTON, 1, -1, "Invert selection", "pad-actions.invert-selection" },
    …
  };
  
  …
  action_group = g_simple_action_group_new ();
  action = g_simple_action_new ("pad-actions.invert-selection", NULL);
  g_signal_connect (action, "activate", on_invert_selection_activated, NULL);
  g_action_map_add_action (G_ACTION_MAP (action_group), action);
  …
  pad_controller = gtk_pad_controller_new (action_group, NULL);
  ```
  
  The actions belonging to rings/strips will be activated with a parameter
  of type `G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE` bearing the value of the given axis, it
  is required that those are made stateful and accepting this [glib.variant_type.VariantType].

  The idea is that you can get one of these from the page setup dialog

  The benefit of splitting this out of the [gtk.print_settings.PrintSettings] is that
  these affect the actual layout of the page, and thus need to be set
  long before user prints.
  
  ## Margins
  
  The margins specified in this object are the “print margins”, i.e. the
  parts of the page that the printer cannot print on. These are different
  from the layout margins that a word processor uses; they are typically
  used to determine the minimal size for the layout margins.

    A widget with two panes, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
  
  ![An example GtkPaned](panes.png)
  
  The division between the two panes is adjustable by the user
  by dragging a handle.
  
  Child widgets are added to the panes of the widget with
  [gtk.paned.Paned.setStartChild] and [gtk.paned.Paned.setEndChild].
  The division between the two children is set by default from the size
  requests of the children, but it can be adjusted by the user.
  
  A paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a
  small handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not
  draw any relief around the children or around the separator. (The space
  in which the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful to put
  each child inside a [gtk.frame.Frame] so that the gutter appears as a
  ridge. No separator is drawn if one of the children is missing.
  
  Each child has two options that can be set, "resize" and "shrink". If
  "resize" is true then, when the [gtk.paned.Paned] is resized, that child will
  expand or shrink along with the paned widget. If "shrink" is true, then
  that child can be made smaller than its requisition by the user.
  Setting "shrink" to false allows the application to set a minimum size.
  If "resize" is false for both children, then this is treated as if
  "resize" is true for both children.
  
  The application can set the position of the slider as if it were set
  by the user, by calling [gtk.paned.Paned.setPosition].

  [gtk.paned.Paned] has a main CSS node with name paned, and a subnode for
  the separator with name separator. The subnode gets a .wide style
  class when the paned is supposed to be wide.
  
  In horizontal orientation, the nodes are arranged based on the text
  direction, so in left-to-right mode, :first-child will select the
  leftmost child, while it will select the rightmost child in
  RTL layouts.

    The [gtk.picture.Picture] widget displays a [gdk.paintable.Paintable].
  
  ![An example GtkPicture](picture.png)
  
  Many convenience functions are provided to make pictures simple to use.
  For example, if you want to load an image from a file, and then display
  it, there’s a convenience function to do this:
  
  ```c
  GtkWidget *widget = gtk_picture_new_for_filename ("myfile.png");
  ```
  
  If the file isn’t loaded successfully, the picture will contain a
  “broken image” icon similar to that used in many web browsers.
  If you want to handle errors in loading the file yourself,
  for example by displaying an error message, then load the image with
  [gdk.texture.Texture.newFromFile], then create the [gtk.picture.Picture] with
  [gtk.picture.Picture.newForPaintable].
  
  Sometimes an application will want to avoid depending on external data
  files, such as image files. See the documentation of [gio.resource.Resource] for details.
  In this case, [gtk.picture.Picture.newForResource] and
  [gtk.picture.Picture.setResource] should be used.
  
  [gtk.picture.Picture] displays an image at its natural size. See [gtk.image.Image]
  if you want to display a fixed-size image, such as an icon.
  
  ## Sizing the paintable
  
  You can influence how the paintable is displayed inside the [gtk.picture.Picture]
  by changing `property@Gtk.Picture:content-fit`. See [gtk.types.ContentFit]
  for details. `property@Gtk.Picture:can-shrink` can be unset to make sure
  that paintables are never made smaller than their ideal size - but
  be careful if you do not know the size of the paintable in use (like
  when displaying user-loaded images). This can easily cause the picture to
  grow larger than the screen. And [gtk.widget.Widget.Align] and

    [gtk.popover.Popover] is a bubble-like context popup.
  
  ![An example GtkPopover](popover.png)
  
  It is primarily meant to provide context-dependent information
  or options. Popovers are attached to a parent widget. By default,
  they point to the whole widget area, although this behavior can be
  changed with [gtk.popover.Popover.setPointingTo].
  
  The position of a popover relative to the widget it is attached to
  can also be changed with [gtk.popover.Popover.setPosition]
  
  By default, [gtk.popover.Popover] performs a grab, in order to ensure input
  events get redirected to it while it is shown, and also so the popover
  is dismissed in the expected situations (clicks outside the popover,
  or the Escape key being pressed). If no such modal behavior is desired
  on a popover, [gtk.popover.Popover.setAutohide] may be called on it to
  tweak its behavior.
  
  ## GtkPopover as menu replacement
  
  [gtk.popover.Popover] is often used to replace menus. The best was to do this
  is to use the [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] subclass which supports being
  populated from a [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] with [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu.newFromModel].
  
  ```xml
  <section>
    <attribute name="display-hint">horizontal-buttons</attribute>
    <item>
      <attribute name="label">Cut</attribute>
      <attribute name="action">app.cut</attribute>
      <attribute name="verb-icon">edit-cut-symbolic</attribute>
    </item>
    <item>
      <attribute name="label">Copy</attribute>
      <attribute name="action">app.copy</attribute>
      <attribute name="verb-icon">edit-copy-symbolic</attribute>
    </item>
    <item>
      <attribute name="label">Paste</attribute>
      <attribute name="action">app.paste</attribute>
      <attribute name="verb-icon">edit-paste-symbolic</attribute>
    </item>
  </section>
  ```
  
  # CSS nodes
  
  ```
  popover.background[.menu]
  ├── arrow
  ╰── contents
      ╰── <child>
  ```
  
  [gtk.popover.Popover] has a main node with name `popover`, an arrow with name `arrow`,
  and another node for the content named `contents`. The `popover` node always
  gets the `.background` style class. It also gets the `.menu` style class
  if the popover is menu-like, e.g. is a [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu].
  
  Particular uses of [gtk.popover.Popover], such as touch selection popups or
  magnifiers in [gtk.entry.Entry] or [gtk.text_view.TextView] get style classes like
  `.touch-selection` or `.magnifier` to differentiate from plain popovers.
  
  When styling a popover directly, the `popover` node should usually
  not have any background. The visible part of the popover can have
  a shadow. To specify it in CSS, set the box-shadow of the `contents` node.
  
  Note that, in order to accomplish appropriate arrow visuals, [gtk.popover.Popover]
  uses custom drawing for the `arrow` node. This makes it possible for the
  arrow to change its shape dynamically, but it also limits the possibilities
  of styling it using CSS. In particular, the `arrow` gets drawn over the
  `content` node's border and shadow, so they look like one shape, which
  means that the border width of the `content` node and the `arrow` node should
  be the same. The arrow also does not support any border shape other than
  solid, no border-radius, only one border width (border-bottom-width is
  used) and no box-shadow.

    [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] is a subclass of [gtk.popover.Popover] that implements menu
  behavior.
  
  ![An example GtkPopoverMenu](menu.png)
  
  [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] treats its children like menus and allows switching
  between them. It can open submenus as traditional, nested submenus,
  or in a more touch-friendly sliding fashion.
  The property [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu.PopoverMenuFlags] controls this appearance.
  
  [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] is meant to be used primarily with menu models,
  using [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu.newFromModel]. If you need to put
  other widgets such as a [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton] or a [gtk.switch_.Switch] into a popover,
  you can use [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu.addChild].
  
  For more dialog-like behavior, use a plain [gtk.popover.Popover].
  
  ## Menu models
  
  The XML format understood by [gtk.builder.Builder] for [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] consists
  of a toplevel `<menu>` element, which contains one or more `<item>`
  elements. Each `<item>` element contains `<attribute>` and `<link>`
  elements with a mandatory name attribute. `<link>` elements have the
  same content model as `<menu>`. Instead of `<link name="submenu">`
  or `<link name="section">`, you can use `<submenu>` or `<section>`
  elements.
  
  ```xml
  <menu id='app-menu'>
    <section>
      <item>
        <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_New Window</attribute>
        <attribute name='action'>app.new</attribute>
      </item>
      <item>
        <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_About Sunny</attribute>
        <attribute name='action'>app.about</attribute>
      </item>
      <item>
        <attribute name='label' translatable='yes'>_Quit</attribute>
        <attribute name='action'>app.quit</attribute>
      </item>
    </section>
  </menu>
  ```
  
  Attribute values can be translated using gettext, like other [gtk.builder.Builder]
  content. `<attribute>` elements can be marked for translation with a
  `translatable="yes"` attribute. It is also possible to specify message
  context and translator comments, using the context and comments attributes.
  To make use of this, the [gtk.builder.Builder] must have been given the gettext
  domain to use.
  
  The following attributes are used when constructing menu items:
  
  $(LIST
    * "label": a user-visible string to display
    * "use-markup": whether the text in the menu item includes [Pango markup](https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/pango_markup.html)
    * "action": the prefixed name of the action to trigger
    * "target": the parameter to use when activating the action
    * "icon" and "verb-icon": names of icons that may be displayed
    * "submenu-action": name of an action that may be used to track
         whether a submenu is open
    * "hidden-when": a string used to determine when the item will be hidden.
         Possible values include "action-disabled", "action-missing", "macos-menubar".
         This is mainly useful for exported menus, see [gtk.application.Application.setMenubar].
    * "custom": a string used to match against the ID of a custom child added with
         [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu.addChild], [gtk.popover_menu_bar.PopoverMenuBar.addChild],
         or in the ui file with `<child type="ID">`.
  )
    
  The following attributes are used when constructing sections:
  
  $(LIST
    * "label": a user-visible string to use as section heading
    * "display-hint": a string used to determine special formatting for the section.
        Possible values include "horizontal-buttons", "circular-buttons" and
        "inline-buttons". They all indicate that section should be
        displayed as a horizontal row of buttons.
    * "text-direction": a string used to determine the [gtk.types.TextDirection] to use
        when "display-hint" is set to "horizontal-buttons". Possible values
        include "rtl", "ltr", and "none".
  )
    
  The following attributes are used when constructing submenus:
  
  $(LIST
    * "label": a user-visible string to display
    * "icon": icon name to display
  )
    
  Menu items will also show accelerators, which are usually associated
  with actions via [gtk.application.Application.setAccelsForAction],
  [gtk.widget_class.WidgetClass.addBindingAction] or
  [gtk.shortcut_controller.ShortcutController.addShortcut].
  
  # CSS Nodes
  
  [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] is just a subclass of [gtk.popover.Popover] that adds custom content
  to it, therefore it has the same CSS nodes. It is one of the cases that add
  a `.menu` style class to the main `popover` node.
  
  Menu items have nodes with name `button` and class `.model`. If a section
  display-hint is set, the section gets a node `box` with class `horizontal`
  plus a class with the same text as the display hint. Note that said box may
  not be the direct ancestor of the item `button`s. Thus, for example, to style
  items in an `inline-buttons` section, select `.inline-buttons button.model`.
  Other things that may be of interest to style in menus include `label` nodes.
  
  # Accessibility
  
  [gtk.popover_menu.PopoverMenu] uses the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.Menu] role, and its
  items use the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.MenuItem],
  [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.MenuItemCheckbox] or
  [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.MenuItemRadio] roles, depending on the
  action they are connected to.

/**
    [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation] is the high-level, portable printing API.
  
  It looks a bit different than other GTK dialogs such as the
  [gtk.file_chooser.FileChooser], since some platforms don’t expose enough
  infrastructure to implement a good print dialog. On such
  platforms, [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation] uses the native print dialog.
  On platforms which do not provide a native print dialog, GTK
  uses its own, see [gtk.print_unix_dialog.PrintUnixDialog].
  
  The typical way to use the high-level printing API is to create
  a [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation] object with [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation.new_]
  when the user selects to print. Then you set some properties on it,
  e.g. the page size, any [gtk.print_settings.PrintSettings] from previous print
  operations, the number of pages, the current page, etc.
  
  Then you start the print operation by calling [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation.run].
  It will then show a dialog, let the user select a printer and options.
  When the user finished the dialog, various signals will be emitted on
  the [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation], the main one being
  `signal@Gtk.PrintOperation::draw-page`, which you are supposed to handle
  and render the page on the provided [gtk.print_context.PrintContext] using Cairo.
  
  # The high-level printing API
  
  ```c
  static GtkPrintSettings *settings = NULL;
  
  static void
  do_print (void)
  {
    GtkPrintOperation *print;
    GtkPrintOperationResult res;
  
    print = gtk_print_operation_new ();
  
    if (settings != NULL)
      gtk_print_operation_set_print_settings (print, settings);
  
    g_signal_connect (print, "begin_print", G_CALLBACK (begin_print), NULL);
    g_signal_connect (print, "draw_page", G_CALLBACK (draw_page), NULL);
  
    res = gtk_print_operation_run (print, GTK_PRINT_OPERATION_ACTION_PRINT_DIALOG,
                                   GTK_WINDOW (main_window), NULL);

  }
  ```
  
  By default [gtk.print_operation.PrintOperation] uses an external application to do
  print preview. To implement a custom print preview, an application
  must connect to the preview signal. The functions
  [gtk.print_operation_preview.PrintOperationPreview.renderPage],
  [gtk.print_operation_preview.PrintOperationPreview.endPreview] and
  [gtk.print_operation_preview.PrintOperationPreview.isSelected]

    [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar] is typically used to display the progress of a long
  running operation.
  
  It provides a visual clue that processing is underway. [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar]
  can be used in two different modes: percentage mode and activity mode.
  
  ![An example GtkProgressBar](progressbar.png)
  
  When an application can determine how much work needs to take place
  (e.g. read a fixed number of bytes from a file) and can monitor its
  progress, it can use the [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar] in percentage mode and the
  user sees a growing bar indicating the percentage of the work that
  has been completed. In this mode, the application is required to call
  [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar.setFraction] periodically to update the progress bar.
  
  When an application has no accurate way of knowing the amount of work
  to do, it can use the [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar] in activity mode, which shows
  activity by a block moving back and forth within the progress area. In
  this mode, the application is required to call [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar.pulse]
  periodically to update the progress bar.
  
  There is quite a bit of flexibility provided to control the appearance
  of the [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar]. Functions are provided to control the orientation
  of the bar, optional text can be displayed along with the bar, and the
  step size used in activity mode can be set.
  
  # CSS nodes
  
  ```
  progressbar[.osd]
  ├── [text]
  ╰── trough[.empty][.full]
      ╰── progress[.pulse]
  ```
  
  [gtk.progress_bar.ProgressBar] has a main CSS node with name progressbar and subnodes with
  names text and trough, of which the latter has a subnode named progress. The
  text subnode is only present if text is shown. The progress subnode has the
  style class .pulse when in activity mode. It gets the style classes .left,
  .right, .top or .bottom added when the progress 'touches' the corresponding
  end of the GtkProgressBar. The .osd class on the progressbar node is for use
  in overlays like the one Epiphany has for page loading progress.

  [gtk.recent_manager.RecentManager] acts like a database of all the recently

  ```c
  GtkRecentManager *manager;
  
  manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();
  gtk_recent_manager_add_item (manager, file_uri);
  ```
  
  The [gtk.recent_manager.RecentManager] will try to gather all the needed information
  from the file itself through GIO.

  ```c
  GtkRecentManager *manager;
  GtkRecentInfo *info;
  GError *error = NULL;
  
  manager = gtk_recent_manager_get_default ();

    }
  else
   {
     // Use the info object
     gtk_recent_info_unref (info);
   }
  ```
  
  In order to retrieve the list of recently used files, you can use
  [gtk.recent_manager.RecentManager.getItems], which returns a list of

  ![An example GtkScale](scales.png)
  
  To use it, you’ll probably want to investigate the methods on its base
  class, [gtk.range.Range], in addition to the methods for [gtk.scale.Scale] itself.
  To set the value of a scale, you would normally use [gtk.range.Range.setValue].
  To detect changes to the value, you would normally use the
  `signal@Gtk.Range::value-changed` signal.
  
  Note that using the same upper and lower bounds for the [gtk.scale.Scale] (through

  applications that want to show an undeterminate value on the scale, without
  changing the layout of the application (such as movie or music players).
  
  # GtkScale as GtkBuildable
  
  [gtk.scale.Scale] supports a custom `<marks>` element, which can contain multiple
  `<mark\>` elements. The “value” and “position” attributes have the same
  meaning as [gtk.scale.Scale.addMark] parameters of the same name. If

  with subnodes named trough and slider.
  
  The main node gets the style class .fine-tune added when the scale is in
  'fine-tuning' mode.
  
  If the scale has an origin (see [gtk.scale.Scale.setHasOrigin]), there is
  a subnode with name highlight below the trough node that is used for rendering
  the highlighted part of the trough.
  
  If the scale is showing a fill level (see [gtk.range.Range.setShowFillLevel]),
  there is a subnode with name fill below the trough node that is used for
  rendering the filled in part of the trough.
  
  If marks are present, there is a marks subnode before or after the trough
  node, below which each mark gets a node with name mark. The marks nodes get
  either the .top or .bottom style class.
  
  The mark node has a subnode named indicator. If the mark has text, it also
  has a subnode named label. When the mark is either above or left of the
  scale, the label subnode is the first when present. Otherwise, the indicator
  subnode is the first.
  
  The main CSS node gets the 'marks-before' and/or 'marks-after' style classes
  added depending on what marks are present.
  
  If the scale is displaying the value (see `property@Gtk.Scale:draw-value`),
  there is subnode with name value. This node will get the .top or .bottom style
  classes similar to the marks node.

/**
    [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] is a container that makes its child scrollable.
  
  It does so using either internally added scrollbars or externally
  associated adjustments, and optionally draws a frame around the child.
  
  Widgets with native scrolling support, i.e. those whose classes implement
  the [gtk.scrollable.Scrollable] interface, are added directly. For other types
  of widget, the class [gtk.viewport.Viewport] acts as an adaptor, giving
  scrollability to other widgets. [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow.setChild]
  intelligently accounts for whether or not the added child is a [gtk.scrollable.Scrollable].
  If it isn’t, then it wraps the child in a [gtk.viewport.Viewport]. Therefore, you can
  just add any child widget and not worry about the details.
  
  If [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow.setChild] has added a [gtk.viewport.Viewport] for you,
  it will be automatically removed when you unset the child.
  Unless `property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:hscrollbar-policy` and
  `property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:vscrollbar-policy` are [gtk.types.PolicyType.Never] or
  [gtk.types.PolicyType.External], [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] adds internal [gtk.scrollbar.Scrollbar] widgets

  effective if the policy causes scrollbars to be present.
  
  If a [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] doesn’t behave quite as you would like, or
  doesn’t have exactly the right layout, it’s very possible to set up
  your own scrolling with [gtk.scrollbar.Scrollbar] and for example a [gtk.grid.Grid].
  
  # Touch support
  
  [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] has built-in support for touch devices. When a
  touchscreen is used, swiping will move the scrolled window, and will
  expose 'kinetic' behavior. This can be turned off with the
  `property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:kinetic-scrolling` property if it is undesired.
  
  [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] also displays visual 'overshoot' indication when
  the content is pulled beyond the end, and this situation can be
  captured with the `signal@Gtk.ScrolledWindow::edge-overshot` signal.
  
  If no mouse device is present, the scrollbars will overlaid as
  narrow, auto-hiding indicators over the content. If traditional
  scrollbars are desired although no mouse is present, this behaviour
  can be turned off with the `property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:overlay-scrolling`
  property.
  
  # CSS nodes
  
  [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] has a main CSS node with name scrolledwindow.
  It gets a .frame style class added when `property@Gtk.ScrolledWindow:has-frame`
  is true.
  
  It uses subnodes with names overshoot and undershoot to draw the overflow
  and underflow indications. These nodes get the .left, .right, .top or .bottom
  style class added depending on where the indication is drawn.
  
  [gtk.scrolled_window.ScrolledWindow] also sets the positional style classes (.left, .right,
  .top, .bottom) and style classes related to overlay scrolling
  (.overlay-indicator, .dragging, .hovering) on its scrollbars.
  
  If both scrollbars are visible, the area where they meet is drawn

  It can also contain additional widgets, such as drop-down menus,
  or buttons.  The search bar would appear when a search is started
  through typing on the keyboard, or the application’s search mode
  is toggled on.
  
  For keyboard presses to start a search, the search bar must be told
  of a widget to capture key events from through
  [gtk.search_bar.SearchBar.setKeyCaptureWidget]. This widget will
  typically be the top-level window, or a parent container of the

  You will also need to tell the search bar about which entry you
  are using as your search entry using [gtk.search_bar.SearchBar.connectEntry].
  
  ## Creating a search bar
  
  The following example shows you how to create a more complex search
  entry.

  The main API for interacting with a [gtk.search_entry.SearchEntry] as entry
  is the [gtk.editable.Editable] interface.
  
  ![An example GtkSearchEntry](search-entry.png)
  
  It will show an inactive symbolic “find” icon when the search
  entry is empty, and a symbolic “clear” icon when there is text.
  Clicking on the “clear” icon will empty the search entry.
  
  To make filtering appear more reactive, it is a good idea to
  not react to every change in the entry text immediately, but
  only after a short delay. To support this, [gtk.search_entry.SearchEntry]
  emits the `signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::search-changed` signal which
  can be used instead of the [gtk.editable.Editable.changed] signal.
  
  The `signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::previous-match`,
  `signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::next-match` and
  `signal@Gtk.SearchEntry::stop-search` signals can be used to
  implement moving between search results and ending the search.
  
  Often, [gtk.search_entry.SearchEntry] will be fed events by means of being
  placed inside a [gtk.search_bar.SearchBar]. If that is not the case,
  you can use [gtk.search_entry.SearchEntry.setKeyCaptureWidget] to

/**
    [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel] is an interface that add support for selection to list models.
  
  This support is then used by widgets using list models to add the ability
  to select and unselect various items.
  
  GTK provides default implementations of the most common selection modes such
  as [gtk.single_selection.SingleSelection], so you will only need to implement this
  interface if you want detailed control about how selections should be handled.
  
  A [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel] supports a single boolean per item indicating if an item is
  selected or not. This can be queried via [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel.isSelected].
  When the selected state of one or more items changes, the model will emit the
  `signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed` signal by calling the
  [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel.selectionChanged] function. The positions given
  in that signal may have their selection state changed, though that is not a
  requirement. If new items added to the model via the
  `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal are selected or not is up to the
  implementation.
  
  Note that items added via `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` may already
  be selected and no `signal@Gtk.SelectionModel::selection-changed` will be
  emitted for them. So to track which items are selected, it is necessary to
  listen to both signals.
  
  Additionally, the interface can expose functionality to select and unselect
  items. If these functions are implemented, GTK's list widgets will allow users
  to select and unselect items. However, [gtk.selection_model.SelectionModel]s are free to only
  implement them partially or not at all. In that case the widgets will not
  support the unimplemented operations.
  
  When selecting or unselecting is supported by a model, the return values of
  the selection functions do *not* indicate if selection or unselection happened.
  They are only meant to indicate complete failure, like when this mode of
  selecting is not supported by the model.
  
  Selections may happen asynchronously, so the only reliable way to find out
  when an item was selected is to listen to the signals that indicate selection.

   1. [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.setup] is emitted to set up permanent
   things on the listitem. This usually means constructing the widgets used in
   the row and adding them to the listitem.
  
   2. [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.bind] is emitted to bind the item passed
   via [gtk.list_item.ListItem.GObject.Object] to the widgets that have been created in
   step 1 or to add item-specific widgets. Signals are connected to listen to
   changes - both to changes in the item to update the widgets or to changes
   in the widgets to update the item. After this signal has been called, the
   listitem may be shown in a list widget.
  
   3. [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.unbind] is emitted to undo everything
   done in step 2. Usually this means disconnecting signal handlers. Once this
   signal has been called, the listitem will no longer be used in a list
   widget.
  
   4. [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.bind] and
   [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.unbind] may be emitted multiple times
   again to bind the listitem for use with new items. By reusing listitems,
   potentially costly setup can be avoided. However, it means code needs to
   make sure to properly clean up the listitem in step 3 so that no information
   from the previous use leaks into the next use.
  
  5. [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.teardown] is emitted to allow undoing
  the effects of [gtk.signal_list_item_factory.SignalListItemFactory.setup]. After this signal
  was emitted on a listitem, the listitem will be destroyed and not be used again.

    [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup] groups widgets together so they all request the same size.
  
  This is typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the
  same size, but you can’t use a [gtk.grid.Grid].
  
  In detail, the size requested for each widget in a [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup] is
  the maximum of the sizes that would have been requested for each
  widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode
  of the size group (see [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup.setMode]) determines whether
  this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.
  
  Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not
  the size that the widgets finally receive. If you want the widgets in
  a [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup] to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in
  such a way that they get the size they request and not more.
  
  [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup] objects are referenced by each widget in the size group,
  so once you have added all widgets to a [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup], you can drop
  the initial reference to the size group with [gobject.object.ObjectG.unref]. If the
  widgets in the size group are subsequently destroyed, then they will
  be removed from the size group and drop their references on the size
  group; when all widgets have been removed, the size group will be
  freed.
  
  Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK will compute the
  horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal requisition of all
  widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups
  of type [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Horizontal] or [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Both], and the
  vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets that can be
  reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
  [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Vertical] or [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Both].
  
  Note that only non-contextual sizes of every widget are ever consulted
  by size groups (since size groups have no knowledge of what size a widget
  will be allocated in one dimension, it cannot derive how much height
  a widget will receive for a given width). When grouping widgets that
  trade height for width in mode [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Vertical] or [gtk.types.SizeGroupMode.Both]:
  the height for the minimum width will be the requested height for all
  widgets in the group. The same is of course true when horizontally grouping
  width for height widgets.
  
  Widgets that trade height-for-width should set a reasonably large minimum
  width by way of `property@Gtk.Label:width-chars` for instance. Widgets with
  static sizes as well as widgets that grow (such as ellipsizing text) need no
  such considerations.
  
  # GtkSizeGroup as GtkBuildable
  
  Size groups can be specified in a UI definition by placing an `<object>`
  element with `class="GtkSizeGroup"` somewhere in the UI definition. The
  widgets that belong to the size group are specified by a `<widgets>` element
  that may contain multiple `<widget>` elements, one for each member of the
  size group. The ”name” attribute gives the id of the widget.

    A [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton] is an ideal way to allow the user to set the
  value of some attribute.
  
  ![An example GtkSpinButton](spinbutton.png)
  
  Rather than having to directly type a number into a [gtk.entry.Entry],
  [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton] allows the user to click on one of two arrows
  to increment or decrement the displayed value. A value can still be
  typed in, with the bonus that it can be checked to ensure it is in a
  given range.
  
  The main properties of a [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton] are through an adjustment.
  See the [gtk.adjustment.Adjustment] documentation for more details about
  an adjustment's properties.
  
  Note that [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton] will by default make its entry large enough
  to accommodate the lower and upper bounds of the adjustment. If this
  is not desired, the automatic sizing can be turned off by explicitly
  setting `property@Gtk.Editable:width-chars` to a value != -1.

    A [gtk.statusbar.Statusbar] widget is usually placed along the bottom of an application's

  status (as is usually the case in a web browser, for example), or may be
  used to simply output a message when the status changes, (when an upload
  is complete in an FTP client, for example).
  
  Status bars in GTK maintain a stack of messages. The message at
  the top of the each bar’s stack is the one that will currently be displayed.
  
  Any messages added to a statusbar’s stack must specify a context id that
  is used to uniquely identify the source of a message. This context id can
  be generated by [gtk.statusbar.Statusbar.getContextId], given a message and
  the statusbar that it will be added to. Note that messages are stored in a
  stack, and when choosing which message to display, the stack structure is
  adhered to, regardless of the context identifier of a message.
  
  One could say that a statusbar maintains one stack of messages for
  display purposes, but allows multiple message producers to maintain
  sub-stacks of the messages they produced (via context ids).
  
  Status bars are created using [gtk.statusbar.Statusbar.new_].
  
  Messages are added to the bar’s stack with [gtk.statusbar.Statusbar.push].
  
  The message at the top of the stack can be removed using
  [gtk.statusbar.Statusbar.pop]. A message can be removed from anywhere in the
  stack if its message id was recorded at the time it was added. This is done
  using [gtk.statusbar.Statusbar.remove].

  For GTK widgets, any [gtk.style_context.StyleContext] returned by
  [gtk.widget.Widget.getStyleContext] will already have a [gdk.display.Display]
  and RTL/LTR information set. The style context will also be updated
  automatically if any of these settings change on the widget.
  
  ## Style Classes
  
  Widgets can add style classes to their context, which can be used to associate
  different styles by class. The documentation for individual widgets lists
  which style classes it uses itself, and which style classes may be added by
  applications to affect their appearance.

  with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_FALLBACK` priority, either a
  [gtk.css_provider.CssProvider] or a custom object implementing the [gtk.style_provider.StyleProvider]

  a [gtk.style_provider.StyleProvider] with the `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION`
  priority, keep in mind that the user settings in
  `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-4.0/gtk.css` will
  still take precedence over your changes, as it uses the
  `GTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_USER` priority.

  [gtk.spin_button.SpinButton], and other widgets. In all of these, [gtk.text.Text] is
  used as the delegate for the [gtk.editable.Editable] implementation.
  
  A fairly large set of key bindings are supported by default. If the

  will scroll so that the cursor position is visible.
  
  When using an entry for passwords and other sensitive information,
  it can be put into “password mode” using [gtk.text.Text.setVisibility].
  In this mode, entered text is displayed using a “invisible” character.
  By default, GTK picks the best invisible character that is available
  in the current font, but it can be changed with
  [gtk.text.Text.setInvisibleChar].
  
  If you are looking to add icons or progress display in an entry, look

  [gtk.text.Text] has a main node with the name `text`. Depending on the properties
  of the widget, the `.read-only` style class may appear.
  
  When the entry has a selection, it adds a subnode with the name `selection`.
  
  When the entry is in overwrite mode, it adds a subnode with the name
  `block-cursor` that determines how the block cursor is drawn.
  
  The CSS node for a context menu is added as a subnode with the name `popup`.
  
  The `undershoot` nodes are used to draw the underflow indication when content
  is scrolled out of view. These nodes get the `.left` or `.right` style class
  added depending on where the indication is drawn.
  
  When touch is used and touch selection handles are shown, they are using
  CSS nodes with name `cursor-handle`. They get the `.top` or `.bottom` style
  class depending on where they are shown in relation to the selection. If
  there is just a single handle for the text cursor, it gets the style class
  `.insertion-cursor`.

    A [gtk.text_mark.TextMark] is a position in a `GtkTextbuffer` that is preserved

  [text widget conceptual overview](section-text-widget.html),
  which gives an overview of all the objects and data types
  related to the text widget and how they work together.
  
  A [gtk.text_mark.TextMark] is like a bookmark in a text buffer; it preserves
  a position in the text. You can convert the mark to an iterator using
  [gtk.text_buffer.TextBuffer.getIterAtMark]. Unlike iterators, marks remain
  valid across buffer mutations, because their behavior is defined when
  text is inserted or deleted. When text containing a mark is deleted,
  the mark remains in the position originally occupied by the deleted
  text. When text is inserted at a mark, a mark with “left gravity” will
  be moved to the beginning of the newly-inserted text, and a mark with
  “right gravity” will be moved to the end.
  
  Note that “left” and “right” here refer to logical direction (left
  is the toward the start of the buffer); in some languages such as
  Hebrew the logically-leftmost text is not actually on the left when
  displayed.
  
  Marks are reference counted, but the reference count only controls
  the validity of the memory; marks can be deleted from the buffer at
  any time with [gtk.text_buffer.TextBuffer.deleteMark]. Once deleted from
  the buffer, a mark is essentially useless.
  
  Marks optionally have names; these can be convenient to avoid passing
  the [gtk.text_mark.TextMark] object around.
  
  Marks are typically created using the [gtk.text_buffer.TextBuffer.createMark]
  function.

    A [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton] is a button which remains “pressed-in” when

  Clicking again will cause the toggle button to return to its normal state.
  
  A toggle button is created by calling either [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton.new_] or
  [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton.newWithLabel]. If using the former, it is advisable
  to pack a widget, (such as a [gtk.label.Label] and/or a [gtk.image.Image]), into the toggle
  button’s container. (See [gtk.button.Button] for more information).
  
  The state of a [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton] can be set specifically using
  [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton.setActive], and retrieved using
  [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton.getActive].
  
  To simply switch the state of a toggle button, use
  [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton.toggled].
  
  ## Grouping
  
  Toggle buttons can be grouped together, to form mutually exclusive
  groups - only one of the buttons can be toggled at a time, and toggling
  another one will switch the currently toggled one off.
  
  To add a [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton] to a group, use [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton.setGroup].
  
  ## CSS nodes
  
  [gtk.toggle_button.ToggleButton] has a single CSS node with name button. To differentiate

    * Connect to the `signal@Gtk.Widget::query-tooltip` signal.
      This signal will be emitted when a tooltip is supposed to be shown.
      One of the arguments passed to the signal handler is a [gtk.tooltip.Tooltip]
      object. This is the object that we are about to display as a tooltip,
      and can be manipulated in your callback using functions like

    [gtk.tree_expander.TreeExpander] is a widget that provides an expander for a list.
  
  It is typically placed as a bottommost child into a [gtk.list_view.ListView]
  to allow users to expand and collapse children in a list with a
  [gtk.tree_list_model.TreeListModel]. [gtk.tree_expander.TreeExpander] provides the common UI
  elements, gestures and keybindings for this purpose.
  
  On top of this, the "listitem.expand", "listitem.collapse" and
  "listitem.toggle-expand" actions are provided to allow adding custom
  UI for managing expanded state.
  
  It is important to mention that you want to set the
  [gtk.list_item.ListItem.gboolean] property to FALSE when using this
  widget, as you want the keyboard focus to be in the treexpander, and not
  inside the list to make use of the keybindings.
  
  The [gtk.tree_list_model.TreeListModel] must be set to not be passthrough. Then it
  will provide [gtk.tree_list_row.TreeListRow] items which can be set via
  [gtk.tree_expander.TreeExpander.setListRow] on the expander.
  The expander will then watch that row item automatically.
  [gtk.tree_expander.TreeExpander.setChild] sets the widget that displays
  the actual row contents.
  
  [gtk.tree_expander.TreeExpander] can be modified with properties such as
  `property@Gtk.TreeExpander:indent-for-icon`,
  `property@Gtk.TreeExpander:indent-for-depth`, and
  `property@Gtk.TreeExpander:hide-expander` to achieve a different appearance.
  This can even be done to influence individual rows, for example by binding
  the `property@Gtk.TreeExpander:hide-expander` property to the item count of
  the model of the treelistrow, to hide the expander for rows without children,
  even if the row is expandable.

  displayed instead.
  
  For every level of depth, another "indent" node is prepended.

    The tree interface used by GtkTreeView
  
  The [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] interface defines a generic tree interface for
  use by the [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] widget. It is an abstract interface, and
  is designed to be usable with any appropriate data structure. The
  programmer just has to implement this interface on their own data
  type for it to be viewable by a [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] widget.
  
  The model is represented as a hierarchical tree of strongly-typed,
  columned data. In other words, the model can be seen as a tree where
  every node has different values depending on which column is being
  queried. The type of data found in a column is determined by using
  the GType system (ie. `G_TYPE_INT`, `GTK_TYPE_BUTTON`, `G_TYPE_POINTER`,
  etc). The types are homogeneous per column across all nodes. It is
  important to note that this interface only provides a way of examining
  a model and observing changes. The implementation of each individual
  model decides how and if changes are made.
  
  In order to make life simpler for programmers who do not need to
  write their own specialized model, two generic models are provided
  — the [gtk.tree_store.TreeStore] and the [gtk.list_store.ListStore]. To use these, the
  developer simply pushes data into these models as necessary. These
  models provide the data structure as well as all appropriate tree
  interfaces. As a result, implementing drag and drop, sorting, and
  storing data is trivial. For the vast majority of trees and lists,
  these two models are sufficient.
  
  Models are accessed on a node/column level of granularity. One can
  query for the value of a model at a certain node and a certain
  column on that node. There are two structures used to reference a
  particular node in a model. They are the [gtk.tree_path.TreePath] and
  the [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter] (“iter” is short for iterator). Most of the
  interface consists of operations on a [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter].
  
  A path is essentially a potential node. It is a location on a model
  that may or may not actually correspond to a node on a specific
  model. A [gtk.tree_path.TreePath] can be converted into either an
  array of unsigned integers or a string. The string form is a list
  of numbers separated by a colon. Each number refers to the offset
  at that level. Thus, the path `0` refers to the root
  node and the path `2:4` refers to the fifth child of
  the third node.
  
  By contrast, a [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter] is a reference to a specific node on
  a specific model. It is a generic struct with an integer and three
  generic pointers. These are filled in by the model in a model-specific
  way. One can convert a path to an iterator by calling
  [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.getIter]. These iterators are the primary way
  of accessing a model and are similar to the iterators used by
  [gtk.text_buffer.TextBuffer]. They are generally statically allocated on the
  stack and only used for a short time. The model interface defines
  a set of operations using them for navigating the model.
  
  It is expected that models fill in the iterator with private data.
  For example, the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] model, which is internally a simple
  linked list, stores a list node in one of the pointers. The
  [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]Sort stores an array and an offset in two of the
  pointers. Additionally, there is an integer field. This field is
  generally filled with a unique stamp per model. This stamp is for
  catching errors resulting from using invalid iterators with a model.
  
  The lifecycle of an iterator can be a little confusing at first.
  Iterators are expected to always be valid for as long as the model
  is unchanged (and doesn’t emit a signal). The model is considered
  to own all outstanding iterators and nothing needs to be done to
  free them from the user’s point of view. Additionally, some models
  guarantee that an iterator is valid for as long as the node it refers
  to is valid (most notably the [gtk.tree_store.TreeStore] and [gtk.list_store.ListStore]).
  Although generally uninteresting, as one always has to allow for
  the case where iterators do not persist beyond a signal, some very
  important performance enhancements were made in the sort model.
  As a result, the [gtk.types.TreeModelFlags.ItersPersist] flag was added to
  indicate this behavior.
  
  To help show some common operation of a model, some examples are
  provided. The first example shows three ways of getting the iter at
  the location `3:2:5`. While the first method shown is
  easier, the second is much more common, as you often get paths from
  callbacks.
  
  ## Acquiring a [gtk.tree_iter.TreeIter]
  
  ```c
  // Three ways of getting the iter pointing to the location
  GtkTreePath *path;
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  GtkTreeIter parent_iter;
  
  // get the iterator from a string
  gtk_tree_model_get_iter_from_string (model,
                                       &iter,
                                       "3:2:5");
  
  // get the iterator from a path
  path = gtk_tree_path_new_from_string ("3:2:5");
  gtk_tree_model_get_iter (model, &iter, path);
  gtk_tree_path_free (path);
  
  // walk the tree to find the iterator
  gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                 NULL, 3);
  parent_iter = iter;
  gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                 &parent_iter, 2);
  parent_iter = iter;
  gtk_tree_model_iter_nth_child (model, &iter,
                                 &parent_iter, 5);
  ```
  
  This second example shows a quick way of iterating through a list
  and getting a string and an integer from each row. The
  populate_model() function used below is not
  shown, as it is specific to the [gtk.list_store.ListStore]. For information on
  how to write such a function, see the [gtk.list_store.ListStore] documentation.
  
  ## Reading data from a [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]
  
  ```c
  enum
  {
    STRING_COLUMN,
    INT_COLUMN,
    N_COLUMNS
  };
  
  ...
  
  GtkTreeModel *list_store;
  GtkTreeIter iter;
  gboolean valid;
  int row_count = 0;
  
  // make a new list_store
  list_store = gtk_list_store_new (N_COLUMNS,
                                   G_TYPE_STRING,
                                   G_TYPE_INT);
  
  // Fill the list store with data
  populate_model (list_store);
  
  // Get the first iter in the list, check it is valid and walk
  // through the list, reading each row.
  
  valid = gtk_tree_model_get_iter_first (list_store,
                                         &iter);
  while (valid)
   {
     char *str_data;
     int    int_data;
  
     // Make sure you terminate calls to gtk_tree_model_get() with a “-1” value
     gtk_tree_model_get (list_store, &iter,
                         STRING_COLUMN, &str_data,
                         INT_COLUMN, &int_data,
                         -1);
  
     // Do something with the data
     g_print ("Row %d: (%s,%d)\n",
              row_count, str_data, int_data);
     g_free (str_data);
  
     valid = gtk_tree_model_iter_next (list_store,
                                       &iter);
     row_count++;
   }
  ```
  
  The [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] interface contains two methods for reference
  counting: [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.refNode] and [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel.unrefNode].
  These two methods are optional to implement. The reference counting
  is meant as a way for views to let models know when nodes are being
  displayed. [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] will take a reference on a node when it is
  visible, which means the node is either in the toplevel or expanded.
  Being displayed does not mean that the node is currently directly
  visible to the user in the viewport. Based on this reference counting
  scheme a caching model, for example, can decide whether or not to cache
  a node based on the reference count. A file-system based model would
  not want to keep the entire file hierarchy in memory, but just the
  folders that are currently expanded in every current view.
  
  When working with reference counting, the following rules must be taken
  into account:
  
  $(LIST
    * Never take a reference on a node without owning a reference on its parent.
      This means that all parent nodes of a referenced node must be referenced
      as well.
    
    * Outstanding references on a deleted node are not released. This is not
      possible because the node has already been deleted by the time the
      row-deleted signal is received.
    
    * Models are not obligated to emit a signal on rows of which none of its
      siblings are referenced. To phrase this differently, signals are only
      required for levels in which nodes are referenced. For the root level
      however, signals must be emitted at all times (however the root level
      is always referenced when any view is attached).

struct GtkTreeModel;

/**
    A [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] which hides parts of an underlying tree model
  
  A [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] is a tree model which wraps another tree model,
  and can do the following things:
  
  $(LIST
    * Filter specific rows, based on data from a “visible column”, a column
      storing booleans indicating whether the row should be filtered or not,
      or based on the return value of a “visible function”, which gets a
      model, iter and user_data and returns a boolean indicating whether the
      row should be filtered or not.
    
    * Modify the “appearance” of the model, using a modify function.
      This is extremely powerful and allows for just changing some
      values and also for creating a completely different model based
      on the given child model.
    
    * Set a different root node, also known as a “virtual root”. You can pass
      in a [gtk.tree_path.TreePath] indicating the root node for the filter at construction
      time.
  )
    
  The basic API is similar to [gtk.tree_model_sort.TreeModelSort]. For an example on its usage,
  see the section on [gtk.tree_model_sort.TreeModelSort].
  
  When using [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter], it is important to realize that
  [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] maintains an internal cache of all nodes which are
  visible in its clients. The cache is likely to be a subtree of the tree
  exposed by the child model. [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] will not cache the entire
  child model when unnecessary to not compromise the caching mechanism
  that is exposed by the reference counting scheme. If the child model
  implements reference counting, unnecessary signals may not be emitted
  because of reference counting rule 3, see the [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]
  documentation. (Note that e.g. [gtk.tree_store.TreeStore] does not implement
  reference counting and will always emit all signals, even when
  the receiving node is not visible).
  
  Because of this, limitations for possible visible functions do apply.
  In general, visible functions should only use data or properties from
  the node for which the visibility state must be determined, its siblings
  or its parents. Usually, having a dependency on the state of any child
  node is not possible, unless references are taken on these explicitly.
  When no such reference exists, no signals may be received for these child
  nodes (see reference counting rule number 3 in the [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] section).
  
  Determining the visibility state of a given node based on the state
  of its child nodes is a frequently occurring use case. Therefore,
  [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] explicitly supports this. For example, when a node
  does not have any children, you might not want the node to be visible.
  As soon as the first row is added to the node’s child level (or the
  last row removed), the node’s visibility should be updated.
  
  This introduces a dependency from the node on its child nodes. In order
  to accommodate this, [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] must make sure the necessary
  signals are received from the child model. This is achieved by building,
  for all nodes which are exposed as visible nodes to [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter]'s
  clients, the child level (if any) and take a reference on the first node
  in this level. Furthermore, for every row-inserted, row-changed or
  row-deleted signal (also these which were not handled because the node
  was not cached), [gtk.tree_model_filter.TreeModelFilter] will check if the visibility state
  of any parent node has changed.
  
  Beware, however, that this explicit support is limited to these two
  cases. For example, if you want a node to be visible only if two nodes
  in a child’s child level (2 levels deeper) are visible, you are on your
  own. In this case, either rely on [gtk.tree_store.TreeStore] to emit all signals
  because it does not implement reference counting, or for models that
  do implement reference counting, obtain references on these child levels
  yourself.

/**
    A GtkTreeModel which makes an underlying tree model sortable
  
  The [gtk.tree_model_sort.TreeModelSort] is a model which implements the [gtk.tree_sortable.TreeSortable]
  interface.  It does not hold any data itself, but rather is created with
  a child model and proxies its data.  It has identical column types to
  this child model, and the changes in the child are propagated.  The
  primary purpose of this model is to provide a way to sort a different
  model without modifying it. Note that the sort function used by
  [gtk.tree_model_sort.TreeModelSort] is not guaranteed to be stable.
  
  The use of this is best demonstrated through an example.  In the
  following sample code we create two [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] widgets each with a
  view of the same data.  As the model is wrapped here by a
  [gtk.tree_model_sort.TreeModelSort], the two [gtk.tree_view.TreeView]s can each sort their
  view of the data without affecting the other.  By contrast, if we
  simply put the same model in each widget, then sorting the first would
  sort the second.
  
  ## Using a [gtk.tree_model_sort.TreeModelSort]
  
  ```c
  {
    GtkTreeView *tree_view1;
    GtkTreeView *tree_view2;
    GtkTreeModel *sort_model1;
    GtkTreeModel *sort_model2;
    GtkTreeModel *child_model;
  
    // get the child model
    child_model = get_my_model ();
  
    // Create the first tree
    sort_model1 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
    tree_view1 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model1);
  
    // Create the second tree
    sort_model2 = gtk_tree_model_sort_new_with_model (child_model);
    tree_view2 = gtk_tree_view_new_with_model (sort_model2);
  
    // Now we can sort the two models independently
    gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model1),
                                          COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_ASCENDING);
    gtk_tree_sortable_set_sort_column_id (GTK_TREE_SORTABLE (sort_model2),
                                          COLUMN_1, GTK_SORT_DESCENDING);
  }
  ```
  
  To demonstrate how to access the underlying child model from the sort
  model, the next example will be a callback for the [gtk.tree_selection.TreeSelection]
  `GtkTreeSelection::changed` signal.  In this callback, we get a string
  from COLUMN_1 of the model.  We then modify the string, find the same
  selected row on the child model, and change the row there.
  
  ## Accessing the child model of in a selection changed callback
  
  ```c
  void
  selection_changed (GtkTreeSelection *selection, gpointer data)
  {
    GtkTreeModel *sort_model = NULL;
    GtkTreeModel *child_model;
    GtkTreeIter sort_iter;
    GtkTreeIter child_iter;
    char *some_data = NULL;
    char *modified_data;
  
    // Get the current selected row and the model.
    if (! gtk_tree_selection_get_selected (selection,
                                           &sort_model,
                                           &sort_iter))
      return;

    // a new value to change it to.

                        COLUMN_1, &some_data,
                        -1);
  
    modified_data = change_the_data (some_data);
    g_free (some_data);
  
    // Get an iterator on the child model, instead of the sort model.

                                                    &sort_iter);
  
    // Get the child model and change the value of the row. In this

    A widget for displaying both trees and lists
  
  Widget that displays any object that implements the [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] interface.
  
  Please refer to the [tree widget conceptual overview](section-tree-widget.html)
  for an overview of all the objects and data types related to the tree
  widget and how they work together.
  
  ## Coordinate systems in GtkTreeView API
  
  Several different coordinate systems are exposed in the [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] API.
  These are:
  
  ![](tree-view-coordinates.png)
  
  $(LIST
    * Widget coordinates: Coordinates relative to the widget (usually `widget->window`).
    
    * Bin window coordinates: Coordinates relative to the window that GtkTreeView renders to.
    
    * Tree coordinates: Coordinates relative to the entire scrollable area of GtkTreeView. These
      coordinates start at (0, 0) for row 0 of the tree.
  )
    
  Several functions are available for converting between the different
  coordinate systems.  The most common translations are between widget and bin
  window coordinates and between bin window and tree coordinates. For the
  former you can use [gtk.tree_view.TreeView.convertWidgetToBinWindowCoords]
  (and vice versa), for the latter [gtk.tree_view.TreeView.convertBinWindowToTreeCoords]
  (and vice versa).
  
  ## [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] as [gtk.buildable.Buildable]
  
  The [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface accepts
  [gtk.tree_view_column.TreeViewColumn] objects as `<child>` elements and exposes the
  internal [gtk.tree_selection.TreeSelection] in UI definitions.
  
  An example of a UI definition fragment with [gtk.tree_view.TreeView]:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkTreeView" id="treeview">
    <property name="model">liststore1</property>
    <child>
      <object class="GtkTreeViewColumn" id="test-column">
        <property name="title">Test</property>
        <child>
          <object class="GtkCellRendererText" id="test-renderer"/>
          <attributes>
            <attribute name="text">1</attribute>
          </attributes>
        </child>
      </object>
    </child>
    <child internal-child="selection">
      <object class="GtkTreeSelection" id="selection">
        <signal name="changed" handler="on_treeview_selection_changed"/>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
  ```
  
  ## CSS nodes
  
  ```
  treeview.view

  │   ├── button
  │   │   ╰── [sort-indicator]
  ┊   ┊
  │   ╰── button
  │       ╰── [sort-indicator]
  │
  ├── [rubberband]
  ╰── [dndtarget]
  ```
  
  [gtk.tree_view.TreeView] has a main CSS node with name `treeview` and style class `.view`.
  It has a subnode with name `header`, which is the parent for all the column
  header widgets' CSS nodes.
  
  Each column header consists of a `button`, which among other content, has a
  child with name `sort-indicator`, which carries the `.ascending` or `.descending`
  style classes when the column header should show a sort indicator. The CSS
  is expected to provide a suitable image using the `-gtk-icon-source` property.
  
  For rubberband selection, a subnode with name `rubberband` is used.
  
  For the drop target location during DND, a subnode with name `dndtarget` is used.

    The base class for all widgets.
  
  [gtk.widget.Widget] is the base class all widgets in GTK derive from. It manages the
  widget lifecycle, layout, states and style.
  
  ### Height-for-width Geometry Management
  
  GTK uses a height-for-width (and width-for-height) geometry management
  system. Height-for-width means that a widget can change how much
  vertical space it needs, depending on the amount of horizontal space
  that it is given (and similar for width-for-height). The most common
  example is a label that reflows to fill up the available width, wraps
  to fewer lines, and therefore needs less height.
  
  Height-for-width geometry management is implemented in GTK by way
  of two virtual methods:
  
  $(LIST
    * `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.get_request_mode`
    * `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure`
  )
    
  There are some important things to keep in mind when implementing
  height-for-width and when using it in widget implementations.
  
  If you implement a direct [gtk.widget.Widget] subclass that supports
  height-for-width or width-for-height geometry management for itself
  or its child widgets, the `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.get_request_mode` virtual
  function must be implemented as well and return the widget's preferred
  request mode. The default implementation of this virtual function
  returns [gtk.types.SizeRequestMode.ConstantSize], which means that the widget will
  only ever get -1 passed as the for_size value to its
  `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure` implementation.
  
  The geometry management system will query a widget hierarchy in
  only one orientation at a time. When widgets are initially queried
  for their minimum sizes it is generally done in two initial passes
  in the [gtk.types.SizeRequestMode] chosen by the toplevel.
  
  For example, when queried in the normal [gtk.types.SizeRequestMode.HeightForWidth] mode:
  
  First, the default minimum and natural width for each widget
  in the interface will be computed using [gtk.widget.Widget.measure] with an
  orientation of [gtk.types.Orientation.Horizontal] and a for_size of -1.
  Because the preferred widths for each widget depend on the preferred
  widths of their children, this information propagates up the hierarchy,
  and finally a minimum and natural width is determined for the entire
  toplevel. Next, the toplevel will use the minimum width to query for the
  minimum height contextual to that width using [gtk.widget.Widget.measure] with an
  orientation of [gtk.types.Orientation.Vertical] and a for_size of the just computed
  width. This will also be a highly recursive operation. The minimum height
  for the minimum width is normally used to set the minimum size constraint
  on the toplevel.
  
  After the toplevel window has initially requested its size in both
  dimensions it can go on to allocate itself a reasonable size (or a size
  previously specified with [gtk.window.Window.setDefaultSize]). During the
  recursive allocation process it’s important to note that request cycles
  will be recursively executed while widgets allocate their children.
  Each widget, once allocated a size, will go on to first share the
  space in one orientation among its children and then request each child's
  height for its target allocated width or its width for allocated height,
  depending. In this way a [gtk.widget.Widget] will typically be requested its size
  a number of times before actually being allocated a size. The size a
  widget is finally allocated can of course differ from the size it has
  requested. For this reason, [gtk.widget.Widget] caches a  small number of results
  to avoid re-querying for the same sizes in one allocation cycle.
  
  If a widget does move content around to intelligently use up the
  allocated size then it must support the request in both
  [gtk.types.SizeRequestMode]s even if the widget in question only
  trades sizes in a single orientation.
  
  For instance, a [gtk.label.Label] that does height-for-width word wrapping
  will not expect to have `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure` with an orientation of
  [gtk.types.Orientation.Vertical] called because that call is specific to a
  width-for-height request. In this case the label must return the height
  required for its own minimum possible width. By following this rule any
  widget that handles height-for-width or width-for-height requests will
  always be allocated at least enough space to fit its own content.
  
  Here are some examples of how a [gtk.types.SizeRequestMode.HeightForWidth] widget
  generally deals with width-for-height requests:
  
  ```c
  static void
  foo_widget_measure (GtkWidget      *widget,
                      GtkOrientation  orientation,
                      int             for_size,
                      int            *minimum_size,
                      int            *natural_size,
                      int            *minimum_baseline,
                      int            *natural_baseline)
  {
    if (orientation == GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL)
      {
        // Calculate minimum and natural width
      }
    else // VERTICAL
      {
        if (i_am_in_height_for_width_mode)
          {
            int min_width, dummy;
  
            // First, get the minimum width of our widget
            GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_HORIZONTAL, -1,
                                                    &min_width, &dummy, &dummy, &dummy);
  
            // Now use the minimum width to retrieve the minimum and natural height to display
            // that width.
            GTK_WIDGET_GET_CLASS (widget)->measure (widget, GTK_ORIENTATION_VERTICAL, min_width,
                                                    minimum_size, natural_size, &dummy, &dummy);
          }
        else
          {
            // ... some widgets do both.
          }
      }
  }
  ```
  
  Often a widget needs to get its own request during size request or
  allocation. For example, when computing height it may need to also
  compute width. Or when deciding how to use an allocation, the widget
  may need to know its natural size. In these cases, the widget should
  be careful to call its virtual methods directly, like in the code
  example above.
  
  It will not work to use the wrapper function [gtk.widget.Widget.measure]
  inside your own `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.size_allocate` implementation.
  These return a request adjusted by [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup], the widget's
  align and expand flags, as well as its CSS style.
  
  If a widget used the wrappers inside its virtual method implementations,
  then the adjustments (such as widget margins) would be applied
  twice. GTK therefore does not allow this and will warn if you try
  to do it.
  
  Of course if you are getting the size request for another widget, such
  as a child widget, you must use [gtk.widget.Widget.measure]; otherwise, you
  would not properly consider widget margins, [gtk.size_group.SizeGroup], and
  so forth.
  
  GTK also supports baseline vertical alignment of widgets. This
  means that widgets are positioned such that the typographical baseline of
  widgets in the same row are aligned. This happens if a widget supports
  baselines, has a vertical alignment using baselines, and is inside
  a widget that supports baselines and has a natural “row” that it aligns to
  the baseline, or a baseline assigned to it by the grandparent.
  
  Baseline alignment support for a widget is also done by the
  `vfunc@Gtk.Widget.measure` virtual function. It allows you to report
  both a minimum and natural size.
  
  If a widget ends up baseline aligned it will be allocated all the space in
  the parent as if it was [gtk.types.Align.Fill], but the selected baseline can be
  found via [gtk.widget.Widget.getBaseline]. If the baseline has a
  value other than -1 you need to align the widget such that the baseline
  appears at the position.
  
  ### GtkWidget as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.widget.Widget] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface
  supports various custom elements to specify additional aspects of widgets
  that are not directly expressed as properties.
  
  If the widget uses a [gtk.layout_manager.LayoutManager], [gtk.widget.Widget] supports
  a custom `<layout>` element, used to define layout properties:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkGrid" id="my_grid">
    <child>
      <object class="GtkLabel" id="label1">
        <property name="label">Description</property>
        <layout>
          <property name="column">0</property>
          <property name="row">0</property>
          <property name="row-span">1</property>
          <property name="column-span">1</property>
        </layout>
      </object>
    </child>
    <child>
      <object class="GtkEntry" id="description_entry">
        <layout>
          <property name="column">1</property>
          <property name="row">0</property>
          <property name="row-span">1</property>
          <property name="column-span">1</property>
        </layout>
      </object>
    </child>
  </object>
  ```
  
  [gtk.widget.Widget] allows style information such as style classes to
  be associated with widgets, using the custom `<style>` element:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
    <style>
      <class name="my-special-button-class"/>
      <class name="dark-button"/>
    </style>
  </object>
  ```
  
  [gtk.widget.Widget] allows defining accessibility information, such as properties,
  relations, and states, using the custom `<accessibility>` element:
  
  ```xml
  <object class="GtkButton" id="button1">
    <accessibility>
      <property name="label">Download</property>
      <relation name="labelled-by">label1</relation>
    </accessibility>
  </object>
  ```
  
  ### Building composite widgets from template XML
  
  `GtkWidget `exposes some facilities to automate the procedure
  of creating composite widgets using "templates".
  
  To create composite widgets with [gtk.builder.Builder] XML, one must associate
  the interface description with the widget class at class initialization
  time using [gtk.widget_class.WidgetClass.setTemplate].
  
  The interface description semantics expected in composite template descriptions
  is slightly different from regular [gtk.builder.Builder] XML.
  
  Unlike regular interface descriptions, [gtk.widget_class.WidgetClass.setTemplate]
  will expect a `<template>` tag as a direct child of the toplevel
  `<interface>` tag. The `<template>` tag must specify the “class” attribute
  which must be the type name of the widget. Optionally, the “parent”
  attribute may be specified to specify the direct parent type of the widget
  type; this is ignored by [gtk.builder.Builder] but can be used by UI design tools to
  introspect what kind of properties and internal children exist for a given
  type when the actual type does not exist.
  
  The XML which is contained inside the `<template>` tag behaves as if it were
  added to the `<object>` tag defining the widget itself. You may set properties
  on a widget by inserting `<property>` tags into the `<template>` tag, and also
  add `<child>` tags to add children and extend a widget in the normal way you
  would with `<object>` tags.
  
  Additionally, `<object>` tags can also be added before and after the initial
  `<template>` tag in the normal way, allowing one to define auxiliary objects
  which might be referenced by other widgets declared as children of the
  `<template>` tag.
  
  Since, unlike the `<object>` tag, the `<template>` tag does not contain an
  “id” attribute, if you need to refer to the instance of the object itself that
  the template will create, simply refer to the template class name in an
  applicable element content.
  
  Here is an example of a template definition, which includes an example of
  this in the `<signal>` tag:
  
  ```xml
  <interface>
    <template class="FooWidget" parent="GtkBox">
      <property name="orientation">horizontal</property>
      <property name="spacing">4</property>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="hello_button">
          <property name="label">Hello World</property>
          <signal name="clicked" handler="hello_button_clicked" object="FooWidget" swapped="yes"/>
        </object>
      </child>
      <child>
        <object class="GtkButton" id="goodbye_button">
          <property name="label">Goodbye World</property>
        </object>
      </child>
    </template>
  </interface>
  ```
  
  Typically, you'll place the template fragment into a file that is
  bundled with your project, using [gio.resource.Resource]. In order to load the
  template, you need to call [gtk.widget_class.WidgetClass.setTemplateFromResource]
  from the class initialization of your [gtk.widget.Widget] type:
  
  ```c
  static void
  foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
  {
    // ...
  
    gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                 "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
  }
  ```
  
  You will also need to call [gtk.widget.Widget.initTemplate] from the
  instance initialization function:
  
  ```c
  static void
  foo_widget_init (FooWidget *self)
  {
    gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (self));
  
    // Initialize the rest of the widget...
  }
  ```
  
  as well as calling [gtk.widget.Widget.disposeTemplate] from the dispose
  function:
  
  ```c
  static void
  foo_widget_dispose (GObject *gobject)
  {
    FooWidget *self = FOO_WIDGET (gobject);
  
    // Dispose objects for which you have a reference...
  
    // Clear the template children for this widget type
    gtk_widget_dispose_template (GTK_WIDGET (self), FOO_TYPE_WIDGET);
  
    G_OBJECT_CLASS (foo_widget_parent_class)->dispose (gobject);
  }
  ```
  
  You can access widgets defined in the template using the
  [gtk.widget.Widget.getTemplateChild] function, but you will typically declare
  a pointer in the instance private data structure of your type using the same
  name as the widget in the template definition, and call
  [gtk.widget_class.WidgetClass.bindTemplateChildFull] (or one of its wrapper macros
  `func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_child` and `func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_child_private`)
  with that name, e.g.
  
  ```c
  typedef struct {
    GtkWidget *hello_button;
    GtkWidget *goodbye_button;
  } FooWidgetPrivate;
  
  G_DEFINE_TYPE_WITH_PRIVATE (FooWidget, foo_widget, GTK_TYPE_BOX)
  
  static void
  foo_widget_dispose (GObject *gobject)
  {
    gtk_widget_dispose_template (GTK_WIDGET (gobject), FOO_TYPE_WIDGET);
  
    G_OBJECT_CLASS (foo_widget_parent_class)->dispose (gobject);
  }
  
  static void
  foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)
  {
    // ...
    G_OBJECT_CLASS (klass)->dispose = foo_widget_dispose;
  
    gtk_widget_class_set_template_from_resource (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                 "/com/example/ui/foowidget.ui");
    gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                  FooWidget, hello_button);
    gtk_widget_class_bind_template_child_private (GTK_WIDGET_CLASS (klass),
                                                  FooWidget, goodbye_button);
  }
  
  static void
  foo_widget_init (FooWidget *widget)
  {
    gtk_widget_init_template (GTK_WIDGET (widget));
  }
  ```
  
  You can also use [gtk.widget_class.WidgetClass.bindTemplateCallbackFull] (or
  is wrapper macro `func@Gtk.widget_class_bind_template_callback`) to connect
  a signal callback defined in the template with a function visible in the
  scope of the class, e.g.
  
  ```c
  // the signal handler has the instance and user data swapped
  // because of the swapped="yes" attribute in the template XML
  static void
  hello_button_clicked (FooWidget *self,
                        GtkButton *button)
  {
    g_print ("Hello, world!\n");
  }
  
  static void
  foo_widget_class_init (FooWidgetClass *klass)

/**
    A [gtk.window.Window] is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
  
  ![An example GtkWindow](window.png)
  
  Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
  of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
  (resize it, move it, close it,...).
  
  # GtkWindow as GtkBuildable
  
  The [gtk.window.Window] implementation of the [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface supports
  setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
  attribute of a `<child>` element.
  
  # CSS nodes
  
  ```
  window.background [.csd / .solid-csd / .ssd] [.maximized / .fullscreen / .tiled]
  ├── <child>
  ╰── <titlebar child>.titlebar [.default-decoration]
  ```
  
  [gtk.window.Window] has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background.
  
  Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
  client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
  without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
  decorations). GtkWindow also represents window states with the following
  style classes on the main node: .maximized, .fullscreen, .tiled (when supported,
  also .tiled-top, .tiled-left, .tiled-right, .tiled-bottom).
  
  [gtk.window.Window] subclasses often add their own discriminating style classes,
  such as .dialog, .popup or .tooltip.
  
  Generally, some CSS properties don't make sense on the toplevel window node,
  such as margins or padding. When client-side decorations without invisible
  borders are in use (i.e. the .solid-csd style class is added to the
  main window node), the CSS border of the toplevel window is used for
  resize drags. In the .csd case, the shadow area outside of the window
  can be used to resize it.
  
  [gtk.window.Window] adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
  widget that is added as a titlebar child.
  
  # Accessibility
  
  Until GTK 4.10, [gtk.window.Window] used the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.Window] role.
  
  Since GTK 4.12, [gtk.window.Window] uses the [gtk.types.AccessibleRole.Application] role.
  
  # Actions
  
  [gtk.window.Window] defines a set of built-in actions:
  $(LIST
    * `default.activate`: Activate the default widget.
    * `window.minimize`: Minimize the window.
    * `window.toggle-maximized`: Maximize or restore the window.
    * `window.close`: Close the window.

  [gtk.window_controls.WindowControls] only displays start or end side of the controls (see
  [gtk.window_controls.WindowControls.PackType]), so it's intended to be always used
  in pair with another [gtk.window_controls.WindowControls] for the opposite side, for example:

  ```
  
  A [gtk.window_controls.WindowControls]' CSS node is called windowcontrols. It contains
  subnodes corresponding to each title button. Which of the title buttons
  exist and where they are placed exactly depends on the desktop environment
  and `property@Gtk.WindowControls:decoration-layout` value.
  
  When [gtk.window_controls.WindowControls.gboolean] is true, it gets the .empty
  style class.
