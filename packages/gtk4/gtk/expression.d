/**
    [gtk.expression.Expression] provides a way to describe references to values.
  
  An important aspect of expressions is that the value can be obtained
  from a source that is several steps away. For example, an expression
  may describe ‘the value of property A of `object1`, which is itself the
  value of a property of `object2`’. And `object1` may not even exist yet
  at the time that the expression is created. This is contrast to [gobject.object.ObjectG]
  property bindings, which can only create direct connections between
  the properties of two objects that must both exist for the duration
  of the binding.
  
  An expression needs to be "evaluated" to obtain the value that it currently
  refers to. An evaluation always happens in the context of a current object
  called `this` (it mirrors the behavior of object-oriented languages),
  which may or may not influence the result of the evaluation. Use
  [gtk.expression.Expression.evaluate] for evaluating an expression.
  
  Various methods for defining expressions exist, from simple constants via
  [gtk.constant_expression.ConstantExpression.new_] to looking up properties in a [gobject.object.ObjectG]
  (even recursively) via [gtk.property_expression.PropertyExpression.new_] or providing
  custom functions to transform and combine expressions via
  [gtk.closure_expression.ClosureExpression.new_].
  
  Here is an example of a complex expression:
  
  ```c
    color_expr = gtk_property_expression_new (GTK_TYPE_LIST_ITEM,
                                              NULL, "item");
    expression = gtk_property_expression_new (GTK_TYPE_COLOR,
                                              color_expr, "name");
  ```
  
  when evaluated with `this` being a [gtk.list_item.ListItem], it will obtain the
  "item" property from the [gtk.list_item.ListItem], and then obtain the "name" property
  from the resulting object (which is assumed to be of type `GTK_TYPE_COLOR`).
  
  A more concise way to describe this would be
  
  ```
    this->item->name
  ```
  
  The most likely place where you will encounter expressions is in the context
  of list models and list widgets using them. For example, [gtk.drop_down.DropDown] is
  evaluating a [gtk.expression.Expression] to obtain strings from the items in its model
  that it can then use to match against the contents of its search entry.
  [gtk.string_filter.StringFilter] is using a [gtk.expression.Expression] for similar reasons.
  
  By default, expressions are not paying attention to changes and evaluation is
  just a snapshot of the current state at a given time. To get informed about
  changes, an expression needs to be "watched" via a [gtk.expression_watch.ExpressionWatch],
  which will cause a callback to be called whenever the value of the expression may
  have changed; [gtk.expression.Expression.watch] starts watching an expression, and
  [gtk.expression_watch.ExpressionWatch.unwatch] stops.
  
  Watches can be created for automatically updating the property of an object,
  similar to GObject's [gobject.binding.Binding] mechanism, by using [gtk.expression.Expression.bind].
  
  ## GtkExpression in GObject properties
  
  In order to use a [gtk.expression.Expression] as a [gobject.object.ObjectG] property, you must use the
  `func@Gtk.param_spec_expression` when creating a [gobject.param_spec.ParamSpec] to install in the
  [gobject.object.ObjectG] class being defined; for instance:
  
  ```c
  obj_props[PROP_EXPRESSION] =
    gtk_param_spec_expression ("expression",
                               "Expression",
                               "The expression used by the widget",
                               G_PARAM_READWRITE |
                               G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS |
                               G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY);
  ```
  
  When implementing the `GObjectClass.set_property` and `GObjectClass.get_property`
  virtual functions, you must use `func@Gtk.value_get_expression`, to retrieve the
  stored [gtk.expression.Expression] from the [gobject.value.Value] container, and `func@Gtk.value_set_expression`,
  to store the [gtk.expression.Expression] into the [gobject.value.Value]; for instance:
  
  ```c
    // in set_property()...
    case PROP_EXPRESSION:
      foo_widget_set_expression (foo, gtk_value_get_expression (value));
      break;
  
    // in get_property()...
    case PROP_EXPRESSION:
      gtk_value_set_expression (value, foo->expression);
      break;
  ```
  
  ## GtkExpression in .ui files
  
  [gtk.builder.Builder] has support for creating expressions. The syntax here can be used where
  a [gtk.expression.Expression] object is needed like in a `<property>` tag for an expression
  property, or in a `<binding name="property">` tag to bind a property to an expression.
  
  To create a property expression, use the `<lookup>` element. It can have a `type`
  attribute to specify the object type, and a `name` attribute to specify the property
  to look up. The content of `<lookup>` can either be an element specifying the expression
  to use the object, or a string that specifies the name of the object to use.
  
  Example:
  
  ```xml
    <lookup name='search'>string_filter</lookup>
  ```
  
  Since the `<lookup>` element creates an expression and its element content can
  itself be an expression, this means that `<lookup>` tags can also be nested.
  This is a common idiom when dealing with [gtk.list_item.ListItem]s. See
  [gtk.builder_list_item_factory.BuilderListItemFactory] for an example of this technique.
  
  To create a constant expression, use the `<constant>` element. If the type attribute
  is specified, the element content is interpreted as a value of that type. Otherwise,
  it is assumed to be an object. For instance:
  
  ```xml
    <constant>string_filter</constant>
    <constant type='gchararray'>Hello, world</constant>
  ```
  
  To create a closure expression, use the `<closure>` element. The `function`
  attribute specifies what function to use for the closure, and the `type`
  attribute specifies its return type. The content of the element contains the
  expressions for the parameters. For instance:
  
  ```xml
    <closure type='gchararray' function='combine_args_somehow'>
      <constant type='gchararray'>File size:</constant>
      <lookup type='GFile' name='size'>myfile</lookup>
    </closure>
  ```
  
  To create a property binding, use the `<binding>` element in place of where a
  `<property>` tag would ordinarily be used. The `name` and `object` attributes are
  supported. The `name` attribute is required, and pertains to the applicable property
  name. The `object` attribute is optional. If provided, it will use the specified object
  as the `this` object when the expression is evaluated. Here is an example in which the
  `label` property of a [gtk.label.Label] is bound to the `string` property of another arbitrary
  object:
  
  ```xml
    <object class='GtkLabel'>
      <binding name='label'>
        <lookup name='string'>some_other_object</lookup>
      </binding>
    </object>
  ```
