/**
    Stores geometrical information for a series of rows in a GtkCellArea
    
    The [gtk.cell_area_context.CellAreaContext] object is created by a given [gtk.cell_area.CellArea]
    implementation via its `GtkCellAreaClass.create_context()` virtual
    method and is used to store cell sizes and alignments for a series of
    [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel] rows that are requested and rendered in the same context.
    
    [gtk.cell_layout.CellLayout] widgets can create any number of contexts in which to
    request and render groups of data rows. However, it’s important that the
    same context which was used to request sizes for a given [gtk.tree_model.TreeModel]
    row also be used for the same row when calling other [gtk.cell_area.CellArea] APIs
    such as [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.render] and [gtk.cell_area.CellArea.event].
