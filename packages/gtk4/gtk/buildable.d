/**
    [gtk.buildable.Buildable] allows objects to extend and customize their deserialization
  from ui files.
  
  The interface includes methods for setting names and properties of objects,
  parsing custom tags and constructing child objects.
  
  The [gtk.buildable.Buildable] interface is implemented by all widgets and
  many of the non-widget objects that are provided by GTK. The
  main user of this interface is [gtk.builder.Builder]. There should be
  very little need for applications to call any of these functions directly.
  
  An object only needs to implement this interface if it needs to extend the
  [gtk.builder.Builder] XML format or run any extra routines at deserialization time.
