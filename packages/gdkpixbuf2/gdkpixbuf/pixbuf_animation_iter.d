  /**
      Possibly advances an animation to a new frame.
    
    Chooses the frame based on the start time passed to
    [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation.PixbufAnimation.getIter].
    
    current_time would normally come from [glib.global.getCurrentTime], and
    must be greater than or equal to the time passed to
    [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation.PixbufAnimation.getIter], and must increase or remain
    unchanged each time [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation_iter.PixbufAnimationIter.getPixbuf] is
    called. That is, you can't go backward in time; animations only
    play forward.
    
    As a shortcut, pass `NULL` for the current time and [glib.global.getCurrentTime]
    will be invoked on your behalf. So you only need to explicitly pass
    current_time if you're doing something odd like playing the animation
    at double speed.
    
    If this function returns `FALSE`, there's no need to update the animation
    display, assuming the display had been rendered prior to advancing;
    if `TRUE`, you need to call [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation_iter.PixbufAnimationIter.getPixbuf]
    and update the display with the new pixbuf.
    Params:
      currentTime =       current time
    Returns:     `TRUE` if the image may need updating

    The `[glib.global.timeoutAdd]` function conveniently takes a timeout in milliseconds,
    so you can use a timeout to schedule the next update.
    
    Note that some formats, like GIF, might clamp the timeout values in the
    image file to avoid updates that are just too quick. The minimum timeout
    for GIF images is currently 20 milliseconds.

    advances to the next frame, which may happen anytime you call
