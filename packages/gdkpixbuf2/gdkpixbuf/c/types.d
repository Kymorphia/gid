/**
    A pixel buffer.
  
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] contains information about an image's pixel data,
  its color space, bits per sample, width and height, and the
  rowstride (the number of bytes between the start of one row
  and the start of the next).
  
  ## Creating new [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf]
  
  The most basic way to create a pixbuf is to wrap an existing pixel
  buffer with a [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] instance. You can use the
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromData] function to do this.
  
  Every time you create a new [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] instance for some data, you
  will need to specify the destroy notification function that will be
  called when the data buffer needs to be freed; this will happen when
  a [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] is finalized by the reference counting functions. If
  you have a chunk of static data compiled into your application, you
  can pass in `NULL` as the destroy notification function so that the
  data will not be freed.
  
  The [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.new_] constructor function can be used
  as a convenience to create a pixbuf with an empty buffer; this is
  equivalent to allocating a data buffer using `malloc()` and then
  wrapping it with `[gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromData]`. The `[gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.new_]`
  function will compute an optimal rowstride so that rendering can be
  performed with an efficient algorithm.
  
  As a special case, you can use the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromXpmData]
  function to create a pixbuf from inline XPM image data.
  
  You can also copy an existing pixbuf with the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.copy]
  function. This is not the same as just acquiring a reference to
  the old pixbuf instance: the copy function will actually duplicate
  the pixel data in memory and create a new `class@Pixbuf` instance
  for it.
  
  ## Reference counting
  
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] structures are reference counted. This means that an
  application can share a single pixbuf among many parts of the
  code. When a piece of the program needs to use a pixbuf, it should
  acquire a reference to it by calling `[gobject.object.ObjectG.ref_]`; when it no
  longer needs the pixbuf, it should release the reference it acquired
  by calling `[gobject.object.ObjectG.unref]`. The resources associated with a
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] will be freed when its reference count drops to zero.
  Newly-created [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] instances start with a reference count
  of one.
  
  ## Image Data
  
  Image data in a pixbuf is stored in memory in an uncompressed,
  packed format. Rows in the image are stored top to bottom, and
  in each row pixels are stored from left to right.
  
  There may be padding at the end of a row.
  
  The "rowstride" value of a pixbuf, as returned by [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.getRowstride],
  indicates the number of bytes between rows.
  
  **NOTE**: If you are copying raw pixbuf data with `memcpy()` note that the
  last row in the pixbuf may not be as wide as the full rowstride, but rather
  just as wide as the pixel data needs to be; that is: it is unsafe to do
  `memcpy (dest, pixels, rowstride * height)` to copy a whole pixbuf. Use
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.copy] instead, or compute the width in bytes of the
  last row as:
  
  ```c
  last_row = width * ((n_channels * bits_per_sample + 7) / 8);
  ```
  
  The same rule applies when iterating over each row of a [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] pixels
  array.
  
  The following code illustrates a simple `put_pixel()`
  function for RGB pixbufs with 8 bits per channel with an alpha
  channel.
  
  ```c
  static void
  put_pixel (GdkPixbuf *pixbuf,
             int x,
  	   int y,
  	   guchar red,
  	   guchar green,
  	   guchar blue,
  	   guchar alpha)
  {
    int n_channels = gdk_pixbuf_get_n_channels (pixbuf);
  
    // Ensure that the pixbuf is valid
    g_assert (gdk_pixbuf_get_colorspace (pixbuf) == GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB);
    g_assert (gdk_pixbuf_get_bits_per_sample (pixbuf) == 8);
    g_assert (gdk_pixbuf_get_has_alpha (pixbuf));
    g_assert (n_channels == 4);
  
    int width = gdk_pixbuf_get_width (pixbuf);
    int height = gdk_pixbuf_get_height (pixbuf);
  
    // Ensure that the coordinates are in a valid range
    g_assert (x >= 0 && x < width);
    g_assert (y >= 0 && y < height);
  
    int rowstride = gdk_pixbuf_get_rowstride (pixbuf);
  
    // The pixel buffer in the GdkPixbuf instance
    guchar *pixels = gdk_pixbuf_get_pixels (pixbuf);
  
    // The pixel we wish to modify
    guchar *p = pixels + y * rowstride + x * n_channels;
    p[0] = red;
    p[1] = green;
    p[2] = blue;
    p[3] = alpha;
  }
  ```
  
  ## Loading images
  
  The `GdkPixBuf` class provides a simple mechanism for loading
  an image from a file in synchronous and asynchronous fashion.
  
  For GUI applications, it is recommended to use the asynchronous
  stream API to avoid blocking the control flow of the application.
  
  Additionally, [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] provides the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader]
  API for progressive image loading.
  
  ## Saving images
  
  The [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] class provides methods for saving image data in
  a number of file formats. The formatted data can be written to a
  file or to a memory buffer. [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] can also call a user-defined
  callback on the data, which allows to e.g. write the image
  to a socket or store it in a database.

/**
    Incremental image loader.
  
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader] provides a way for applications to drive the
  process of loading an image, by letting them send the image data
  directly to the loader instead of having the loader read the data
  from a file. Applications can use this functionality instead of
  `[gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf.newFromFile]` or `[gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation.PixbufAnimation.newFromFile]`
  when they need to parse image data in small chunks. For example,
  it should be used when reading an image from a (potentially) slow
  network connection, or when loading an extremely large file.
  
  To use [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader] to load an image, create a new instance,
  and call [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader.write] to send the data
  to it. When done, [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader.close] should be
  called to end the stream and finalize everything.
  
  The loader will emit three important signals throughout the process:
  
   $(LIST
      * `signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::size-prepared` will be emitted as
        soon as the image has enough information to determine the size of
        the image to be used. If you want to scale the image while loading
        it, you can call [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader.setSize] in
        response to this signal.
      * `signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-prepared` will be emitted as
        soon as the pixbuf of the desired has been allocated. You can obtain
        the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] instance by calling [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader.getPixbuf].
        If you want to use it, simply acquire a reference to it. You can
        also call `[gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader.getPixbuf]` later to get the same
        pixbuf.
      * `signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-updated` will be emitted every
        time a region is updated. This way you can update a partially
        completed image. Note that you do not know anything about the
        completeness of an image from the updated area. For example, in an
        interlaced image you will need to make several passes before the
        image is done loading.
   )
     
  ## Loading an animation
  
  Loading an animation is almost as easy as loading an image. Once the
  first `signal@GdkPixbuf.PixbufLoader::area-prepared` signal has been
  emitted, you can call [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_loader.PixbufLoader.getAnimation] to
  get the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation.PixbufAnimation] instance, and then call
  and [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation.PixbufAnimation.getIter] to get a
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_animation_iter.PixbufAnimationIter] to retrieve the pixbuf for the
  desired time stamp.

    A [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_module.PixbufModule] contains the necessary functions to load and save
  images in a certain file format.
  
  If [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] has been compiled with [gmodule.module_.Module] support, it can be extended
  by modules which can load (and perhaps also save) new image and animation
  formats.
  
  ## Implementing modules
  
  The [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] interfaces needed for implementing modules are contained in
  `gdk-pixbuf-io.h` (and `gdk-pixbuf-animation.h` if the module supports
  animations). They are not covered by the same stability guarantees as the
  regular GdkPixbuf API. To underline this fact, they are protected by the
  `GDK_PIXBUF_ENABLE_BACKEND` pre-processor symbol.
  
  Each loadable module must contain a [gdkpixbuf.types.PixbufModuleFillVtableFunc] function
  named `fill_vtable`, which will get called when the module
  is loaded and must set the function pointers of the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_module.PixbufModule].
  
  In order to make format-checking work before actually loading the modules
  (which may require calling `dlopen` to load image libraries), modules export
  their signatures (and other information) via the `fill_info` function. An
  external utility, `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders`, uses this to create a text
  file containing a list of all available loaders and  their signatures.
  This file is then read at runtime by [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf] to obtain the list of
  available loaders and their signatures.
  
  Modules may only implement a subset of the functionality available via
  [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_module.PixbufModule]. If a particular functionality is not implemented, the
  `fill_vtable` function will simply not set the corresponding
  function pointers of the [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf_module.PixbufModule] structure. If a module supports
  incremental loading (i.e. provides `begin_load`, `stop_load` and
  `load_increment`), it doesn't have to implement `load`, since [gdkpixbuf.pixbuf.Pixbuf]
  can supply a generic `load` implementation wrapping the incremental loading.
  
  ## Installing modules
  
  Installing a module is a two-step process:
  
   $(LIST
      * copy the module file(s) to the loader directory (normally
        `$libdir/gdk-pixbuf-2.0/$version/loaders`, unless overridden by the
        environment variable `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULEDIR`)
      * call `gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders` to update the module file (normally

        by the environment variable `GDK_PIXBUF_MODULE_FILE`)

    The signature prefix for a module.
  
  The signature of a module is a set of prefixes. Prefixes are encoded as
  pairs of ordinary strings, where the second string, called the mask, if

  ' ', '!', 'x', 'z', and 'n' to indicate bytes that must be matched,
  not matched, "don't-care"-bytes, zeros and non-zeros, respectively.
  
  Each prefix has an associated integer that describes the relevance of
  the prefix, with 0 meaning a mismatch and 100 a "perfect match".
  
  Starting with gdk-pixbuf 2.8, the first byte of the mask may be '*',
