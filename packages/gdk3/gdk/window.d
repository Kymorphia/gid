      the invalid region for each window and watch redraws as they
      occur. This allows you to diagnose inefficiencies in your application.
      
      In essence, because the GDK rendering model prevents all flicker,
      if you are redrawing the same region 400 times you may never
      notice, aside from noticing a speed problem. Enabling update
      debugging causes GTK to flicker slowly and noticeably, so you can
      see exactly what’s being redrawn when, in what order.
      
      The --gtk-debug=updates command line option passed to GTK+ programs
      enables this debug option at application startup time. That's
      usually more useful than calling [gdk.window.Window.setDebugUpdates]
      yourself, though you might want to use this function to enable
      updates sometime after application startup time.

  /**
      Indicates that you are beginning the process of redrawing region
      on window, and provides you with a #GdkDrawingContext.
      
      If window is a top level #GdkWindow, backed by a native window
      implementation, a backing store (offscreen buffer) large enough to
      contain region will be created. The backing store will be initialized
      with the background color or background surface for window. Then, all
      drawing operations performed on window will be diverted to the
      backing store. When you call gdk_window_end_frame(), the contents of
      the backing store will be copied to window, making it visible
      on screen. Only the part of window contained in region will be
      modified; that is, drawing operations are clipped to region.
      
      The net result of all this is to remove flicker, because the user
      sees the finished product appear all at once when you call
      [gdk.window.Window.endDrawFrame]. If you draw to window directly without
      calling [gdk.window.Window.beginDrawFrame], the user may see flicker

      widget has a cleared background, is already set as the clip region,
      and already has a backing store. Therefore in most cases, application

      A backing store (offscreen buffer) large enough to contain region
      will be created. The backing store will be initialized with the
      background color or background surface for window. Then, all
      drawing operations performed on window will be diverted to the

      store will be copied to window, making it visible onscreen. Only
      the part of window contained in region will be modified; that is,
      drawing operations are clipped to region.
      
      The net result of all this is to remove flicker, because the user
      sees the finished product appear all at once when you call
      [gdk.window.Window.endPaint]. If you draw to window directly without
      calling [gdk.window.Window.beginPaintRegion], the user may see flicker
      as individual drawing operations are performed in sequence.  The
      clipping and background-initializing features of
      [gdk.window.Window.beginPaintRegion] are conveniences for the
      programmer, so you can avoid doing that work yourself.
      
      When using GTK+, the widget system automatically places calls to
      [gdk.window.Window.beginPaintRegion] and [gdk.window.Window.endPaint] around
      emissions of the expose_event signal. That is, if you’re writing an
      expose event handler, you can assume that the exposed area in
      #GdkEventExpose has already been cleared to the window background,
      is already set as the clip region, and already has a backing store.
      Therefore in most cases, application code need not call
      [gdk.window.Window.beginPaintRegion]. (You can disable the automatic
      calls around expose events on a widget-by-widget basis by calling
      [gtk.widget.Widget.setDoubleBuffered].)
      
      If you call this function multiple times before calling the
      matching [gdk.window.Window.endPaint], the backing stores are pushed onto
      a stack. [gdk.window.Window.endPaint] copies the topmost backing store
      onscreen, subtracts the topmost region from all other regions in
      the stack, and pops the stack. All drawing operations affect only
      the topmost backing store in the stack. One matching call to
      [gdk.window.Window.endPaint] is required for each call to
      [gdk.window.Window.beginPaintRegion].

      flipped_rect is the ideal position of window after any possible
      flipping, but before any possible sliding. final_rect is flipped_rect,
      but possibly translated in the case that flipping is still ineffective in
      keeping window on-screen.
