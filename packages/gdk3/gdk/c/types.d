/**
    In addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user interface input,
    GDK contains support for a variety of input devices, including graphics
    tablets, touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards interacting
    simultaneously with the user interface. Such input devices often have
    additional features, such as sub-pixel positioning information and
    additional device-dependent information.
    
    In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the
    device hierarchy (such as virtual devices being created or removed, or
    physical devices being plugged or unplugged), GDK provides
    #GdkDeviceManager.
    
    By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
    keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be
    changed by calling [gdk.global.disableMultidevice] before [gdk.display.Display.open].
    There should rarely be a need to do that though, since GDK defaults
    to a compatibility mode in which it will emit just one enter/leave
    event pair for all devices on a window. To enable per-device
    enter/leave events and other multi-pointer interaction features,
    [gdk.window.Window.setSupportMultidevice] must be called on
    #GdkWindows (or [gtk.widget.Widget.setSupportMultidevice] on widgets).
    window. See the [gdk.window.Window.setSupportMultidevice] documentation
    for more information.
    
    On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2.
    Unless [gdk.global.disableMultidevice] is called, the XInput 2
    #GdkDeviceManager implementation will be used as the input source.
    Otherwise either the core or XInput 1 implementations will be used.
    
    For simple applications that don’t have any special interest in
    input devices, the so-called “client pointer”
    provides a reasonable approximation to a simple setup with a single
    pointer and keyboard. The device that has been set as the client
    pointer can be accessed via [gdk.device_manager.DeviceManager.getClientPointer].
    
    Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual
    devices (or master devices) are represented by the pointer cursors
    and keyboard foci that are seen on the screen. Physical devices (or
    slave devices) represent the hardware that is controlling the virtual
    devices, and thus have no visible cursor on the screen.
    
    Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
    pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through
    [gdk.device.Device.getAssociatedDevice].
    
    There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could
    be controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also
    be “floating”, which means they are not attached to any virtual device.

    By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all
    master devices, setting the #GdkDevice for all events coming from input
    devices. Events containing device information are #GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY,
    #GDK_BUTTON_PRESS, #GDK_2BUTTON_PRESS, #GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS,
    #GDK_BUTTON_RELEASE, #GDK_SCROLL, #GDK_KEY_PRESS, #GDK_KEY_RELEASE,
    #GDK_ENTER_NOTIFY, #GDK_LEAVE_NOTIFY, #GDK_FOCUS_CHANGE,
    #GDK_PROXIMITY_IN, #GDK_PROXIMITY_OUT, #GDK_DRAG_ENTER, #GDK_DRAG_LEAVE,
    #GDK_DRAG_MOTION, #GDK_DRAG_STATUS, #GDK_DROP_START, #GDK_DROP_FINISHED
    and #GDK_GRAB_BROKEN. When dealing with an event on a master device,
    it is possible to get the source (slave) device that the event originated
    from via [gdk.event.Event.getSourceDevice].
    
    On a standard session, all physical devices are connected by default to
    the "Virtual Core Pointer/Keyboard" master devices, hence routing all events
    through these. This behavior is only modified by device grabs, where the
    slave device is temporarily detached for as long as the grab is held, and
    more permanently by user modifications to the device hierarchy.
    
    On certain application specific setups, it may make sense
    to detach a physical device from its master pointer, and mapping it to
    an specific window. This can be achieved by the combination of
    [gdk.device.Device.grab] and [gdk.device.Device.setMode].
    
    In order to listen for events coming from devices
    other than a virtual device, [gdk.window.Window.setDeviceEvents] must be
    called. Generally, this function can be used to modify the event mask
    for any given device.
    
    Input devices may also provide additional information besides X/Y.
    For example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and X/Y tilt
    information. This information is device-dependent, and may be
    queried through [gdk.device.Device.getAxis]. In multidevice mode, virtual
    devices will change axes in order to always represent the physical

    access the keyboard(s) and mouse pointer(s) of the display.

    singleton, but that should be rarely necessary. Typically, initializing

    The GDK library can be built with support for multiple backends.
    The #GdkDisplayManager object determines which backend is used
    at runtime.
    
    When writing backend-specific code that is supposed to work with
    multiple GDK backends, you have to consider both compile time and
    runtime. At compile time, use the #GDK_WINDOWING_X11, #GDK_WINDOWING_WIN32
    macros, etc. to find out which backends are present in the GDK library
    you are building your application against. At runtime, use type-check
    macros like GDK_IS_X11_DISPLAY() to find out which backend is in use:

    A #GdkFrameClock tells the application when to update and repaint a
    window. This may be synced to the vertical refresh rate of the
    monitor, for example. Even when the frame clock uses a simple timer
    rather than a hardware-based vertical sync, the frame clock helps
    because it ensures everything paints at the same time (reducing the
    total number of frames). The frame clock can also automatically
    stop painting when it knows the frames will not be visible, or
    scale back animation framerates.
    
    #GdkFrameClock is designed to be compatible with an OpenGL-based
    implementation or with mozRequestAnimationFrame in Firefox,
    for example.
    
    A frame clock is idle until someone requests a frame with
    [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.requestPhase]. At some later point that makes
    sense for the synchronization being implemented, the clock will
    process a frame and emit signals for each phase that has been
    requested. (See the signals of the #GdkFrameClock class for
    documentation of the phases. [gdk.types.FrameClockPhase.Update] and the
    #GdkFrameClock::update signal are most interesting for application
    writers, and are used to update the animations, using the frame time
    given by [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.getFrameTime].
    
    The frame time is reported in microseconds and generally in the same
    timescale as [glib.global.getMonotonicTime], however, it is not the same
    as [glib.global.getMonotonicTime]. The frame time does not advance during
    the time a frame is being painted, and outside of a frame, an attempt
    is made so that all calls to [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.getFrameTime] that
    are called at a “similar” time get the same value. This means that
    if different animations are timed by looking at the difference in
    time between an initial value from [gdk.frame_clock.FrameClock.getFrameTime]
    and the value inside the #GdkFrameClock::update signal of the clock,
    they will stay exactly synchronized.

    #GdkGLContext is an object representing the platform-specific

    #GdkGLContexts are created for a #GdkWindow using
    [gdk.window.Window.createGlContext], and the context will match
    the #GdkVisual of the window.
    
    A #GdkGLContext is not tied to any particular normal framebuffer.
    For instance, it cannot draw to the #GdkWindow back buffer. The GDK
    repaint system is in full control of the painting to that. Instead,
    you can create render buffers or textures and use [gdk.global.cairoDrawFromGl]
    in the draw function of your widget to draw them. Then GDK will handle
    the integration of your rendering with that of other widgets.
    
    Support for #GdkGLContext is platform-specific, context creation
    can fail, returning null context.
    
    A #GdkGLContext has to be made "current" in order to start using
    it, otherwise any OpenGL call will be ignored.
    
    ## Creating a new OpenGL context ##
    
    In order to create a new #GdkGLContext instance you need a
    #GdkWindow, which you typically get during the realize call
    of a widget.
    
    A #GdkGLContext is not realized until either [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.makeCurrent],
    or until it is realized using [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.realize]. It is possible to
    specify details of the GL context like the OpenGL version to be used, or
    whether the GL context should have extra state validation enabled after
    calling [gdk.window.Window.createGlContext] by calling [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.realize].
    If the realization fails you have the option to change the settings of the
    #GdkGLContext and try again.
    
    ## Using a GdkGLContext ##
    
    You will need to make the #GdkGLContext the current context
    before issuing OpenGL calls; the system sends OpenGL commands to
    whichever context is current. It is possible to have multiple
    contexts, so you always need to ensure that the one which you
    want to draw with is the current one before issuing commands:
    
    ```c
      gdk_gl_context_make_current (context);
    ```
    
    You can now perform your drawing using OpenGL commands.
    
    You can check which #GdkGLContext is the current one by using
    [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.getCurrent]; you can also unset any #GdkGLContext
    that is currently set by calling [gdk.glcontext.GLContext.clearCurrent].
*/
struct GdkGLContext;

/**
    The #GdkGeometry struct gives the window manager information about
    a window’s geometry constraints. Normally you would set these on
    the GTK+ level using [gtk.window.Window.setGeometryHints]. #GtkWindow
    then sets the hints on the #GdkWindow it creates.
    
    [gdk.window.Window.setGeometryHints] expects the hints to be fully valid already
    and simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast,
    [gtk.window.Window.setGeometryHints] performs some interpretation. For example,
    #GtkWindow will apply the hints to the geometry widget instead of the
    toplevel window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the
    @min_width/@min_height/@max_width/@max_height fields may be set to -1, and
    #GtkWindow will substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget.
    If the minimum size hint is not provided, #GtkWindow will use its requisition
    as the minimum size. If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is
    set, #GtkWindow will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the
    geometry widget rather than the entire window. The base size is treated
    similarly.
    
    The canonical use-case for [gtk.window.Window.setGeometryHints] is to get a
    terminal widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should be
    the geometry widget; #GtkWindow will then automatically set the base size to
    the size of other widgets in the terminal window, such as the menubar and
    scrollbar. Then, the @width_inc and @height_inc fields should be set to the
    size of one character in the terminal. Finally, the base size should be set
    to the size of one character. The net effect is that the minimum size of the
    terminal will have a 1x1 character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on
    the “character grid” will be allowed.
    
    Here’s an example of how the terminal example would be implemented, assuming
    a terminal area widget called “terminal” and a toplevel window “toplevel”:
    
    ```c
    	GdkGeometry hints;
    
    	hints.base_width = terminal->char_width;
            hints.base_height = terminal->char_height;
            hints.min_width = terminal->char_width;
            hints.min_height = terminal->char_height;
            hints.width_inc = terminal->char_width;
            hints.height_inc = terminal->char_height;
    
     gtk_window_set_geometry_hints (GTK_WINDOW (toplevel),
                                    GTK_WIDGET (terminal),
                                    &hints,
                                    GDK_HINT_RESIZE_INC |
                                    GDK_HINT_MIN_SIZE |
                                    GDK_HINT_BASE_SIZE);
    ```
    
    The other useful fields are the @min_aspect and @max_aspect fields; these
    contain a width/height ratio as a floating point number. If a geometry widget
    is set, the aspect applies to the geometry widget rather than the entire
    window. The most common use of these hints is probably to set @min_aspect and
    @max_aspect to the same value, thus forcing the window to keep a constant
    aspect ratio.
