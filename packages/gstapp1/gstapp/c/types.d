    Appsink is a sink plugin that supports many different methods for making
  the application get a handle on the GStreamer data in a pipeline. Unlike
  most GStreamer elements, Appsink provides external API functions.
  
  appsink can be used by linking to the gstappsink.h header file to access the
  methods or by using the appsink action signals and properties.
  
  The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
  [gstapp.app_sink.AppSink.pullSample] and [gstapp.app_sink.AppSink.pullPreroll] methods.
  These methods block until a sample becomes available in the sink or when the
  sink is shut down or reaches EOS. There are also timed variants of these
  methods, [gstapp.app_sink.AppSink.tryPullSample] and [gstapp.app_sink.AppSink.tryPullPreroll],
  which accept a timeout parameter to limit the amount of time to wait.
  
  Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming
  thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast enough, this queue
  will consume a lot of memory over time. The "max-buffers", "max-time" and "max-bytes"
  properties can be used to limit the queue size. The "drop" property controls whether the
  streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum
  queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively
  affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
  
  If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the "emit-signals" property
  to true will make appsink emit the "new-sample" and "new-preroll" signals
  when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
  
  The "caps" property on appsink can be used to control the formats that
  appsink can receive. This property can contain non-fixed caps, the format of
  the pulled samples can be obtained by getting the sample caps.
  
  If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return null, the appsink
  is stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state with the
  "eos" property or with the [gstapp.app_sink.AppSink.isEos] method.
  
  The eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is reached
  to avoid polling.

/**
    The appsrc element can be used by applications to insert data into a
  GStreamer pipeline. Unlike most GStreamer elements, appsrc provides
  external API functions.
  
  appsrc can be used by linking with the libgstapp library to access the
  methods directly or by using the appsrc action signals.
  
  Before operating appsrc, the caps property must be set to fixed caps
  describing the format of the data that will be pushed with appsrc. An
  exception to this is when pushing buffers with unknown caps, in which case no
  caps should be set. This is typically true of file-like sources that push raw
  byte buffers. If you don't want to explicitly set the caps, you can use
  gst_app_src_push_sample. This method gets the caps associated with the
  sample and sets them on the appsrc replacing any previously set caps (if
  different from sample's caps).
  
  The main way of handing data to the appsrc element is by calling the
  [gstapp.app_src.AppSrc.pushBuffer] method or by emitting the push-buffer action signal.
  This will put the buffer onto a queue from which appsrc will read from in its
  streaming thread. It is important to note that data transport will not happen
  from the thread that performed the push-buffer call.
  
  The "max-bytes", "max-buffers" and "max-time" properties control how much
  data can be queued in appsrc before appsrc considers the queue full. A
  filled internal queue will always signal the "enough-data" signal, which
  signals the application that it should stop pushing data into appsrc. The
  "block" property will cause appsrc to block the push-buffer method until
  free data becomes available again.
  
  When the internal queue is running out of data, the "need-data" signal is
  emitted, which signals the application that it should start pushing more data
  into appsrc.
  
  In addition to the "need-data" and "enough-data" signals, appsrc can emit the
  "seek-data" signal when the "stream-mode" property is set to "seekable" or
  "random-access". The signal argument will contain the new desired position in
  the stream expressed in the unit set with the "format" property. After
  receiving the seek-data signal, the application should push-buffers from the
  new position.
  
  These signals allow the application to operate the appsrc in two different
  ways:
  
  The push mode, in which the application repeatedly calls the push-buffer/push-sample
  method with a new buffer/sample. Optionally, the queue size in the appsrc
  can be controlled with the enough-data and need-data signals by respectively
  stopping/starting the push-buffer/push-sample calls. This is a typical
  mode of operation for the stream-type "stream" and "seekable". Use this
  mode when implementing various network protocols or hardware devices.
  
  The pull mode, in which the need-data signal triggers the next push-buffer call.
  This mode is typically used in the "random-access" stream-type. Use this
  mode for file access or other randomly accessible sources. In this mode, a
  buffer of exactly the amount of bytes given by the need-data signal should be
  pushed into appsrc.
  
  In all modes, the size property on appsrc should contain the total stream
  size in bytes. Setting this property is mandatory in the random-access mode.
  For the stream and seekable modes, setting this property is optional but
  recommended.
  
  When the application has finished pushing data into appsrc, it should call
  [gstapp.app_src.AppSrc.endOfStream] or emit the end-of-stream action signal. After
  this call, no more buffers can be pushed into appsrc until a flushing seek
  occurs or the state of the appsrc has gone through READY.
