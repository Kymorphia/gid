/**
    A #GstPipeline is a special #GstBin used as the toplevel container for
  the filter graph. The #GstPipeline will manage the selection and
  distribution of a global #GstClock as well as provide a #GstBus to the
  application.
  
  [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.new_] is used to create a pipeline. when you are done with
  the pipeline, use [gst.object.ObjectGst.unref] to free its resources including all
  added #GstElement objects (if not otherwise referenced).
  
  Elements are added and removed from the pipeline using the #GstBin
  methods like [gst.bin.Bin.add] and [gst.bin.Bin.remove] (see #GstBin).
  
  Before changing the state of the #GstPipeline (see #GstElement) a #GstBus
  should be retrieved with [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.getBus]. This #GstBus should then
  be used to receive #GstMessage from the elements in the pipeline. Listening
  to the #GstBus is necessary for retrieving error messages from the
  #GstPipeline and otherwise the #GstPipeline might stop without any
  indication, why. Furthermore, the #GstPipeline posts messages even if
  nobody listens on the #GstBus, which will pile up and use up memory.
  
  By default, a #GstPipeline will automatically flush the pending #GstBus
  messages when going to the NULL state to ensure that no circular
  references exist when no messages are read from the #GstBus. This
  behaviour can be changed with [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.setAutoFlushBus].
  
  When the #GstPipeline performs the PAUSED to PLAYING state change it will
  select a clock for the elements. The clock selection algorithm will by
  default select a clock provided by an element that is most upstream
  (closest to the source). For live pipelines (ones that return
  #GST_STATE_CHANGE_NO_PREROLL from the [gst.element.Element.setState] call) this
  will select the clock provided by the live source. For normal pipelines
  this will select a clock provided by the sinks (most likely the audio
  sink). If no element provides a clock, a default #GstSystemClock is used.
  
  The clock selection can be controlled with the [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.useClock]
  method, which will enforce a given clock on the pipeline. With
  [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.autoClock] the default clock selection algorithm can be
  restored.
  
  A #GstPipeline maintains a running time for the elements. The running
  time is defined as the difference between the current clock time and
  the base time. When the pipeline goes to READY or a flushing seek is
  performed on it, the running time is reset to 0. When the pipeline is
  set from PLAYING to PAUSED, the current clock time is sampled and used to
  configure the base time for the elements when the pipeline is set
  to PLAYING again. The effect is that the running time (as the difference
  between the clock time and the base time) will count how much time was spent
  in the PLAYING state. This default behaviour can be changed with the
  [gst.element.Element.setStartTime] method.
