/**
    The event class provides factory methods to construct events for sending
  and functions to query (parse) received events.
  
  Events are usually created with gst_event_new_*() which takes event-type
  specific parameters as arguments.
  To send an event application will usually use [gst.element.Element.sendEvent] and
  elements will use [gst.pad.Pad.sendEvent] or [gst.pad.Pad.pushEvent].
  The event should be unreffed with gst_event_unref() if it has not been sent.
  
  Events that have been received can be parsed with their respective
  gst_event_parse_*() functions. It is valid to pass null for unwanted details.
  
  Events are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events
  are serialized with buffers, others are not. Some events only travel downstream,
  others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream.
  
  The events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as
  EOS (end of stream) or the start of a new stream-segment.
  Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data.
  
  Most of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only
  construct and use seek events.
  To do that [gst.event.Event.newSeek] is used to create a seek event. It takes
  the needed parameters to specify seeking time and mode.
  ```c
    GstEvent *event;
    gboolean result;
    ...
    // construct a seek event to play the media from second 2 to 5, flush
    // the pipeline to decrease latency.
    event = gst_event_new_seek (1.0,
       GST_FORMAT_TIME,
       GST_SEEK_FLAG_FLUSH,
       GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, 2 * GST_SECOND,
       GST_SEEK_TYPE_SET, 5 * GST_SECOND);
    ...
    result = gst_element_send_event (pipeline, event);
    if (!result)
      g_warning ("seek failed");
    ...

      Creates a new event containing information specific to a particular

    In order for a decryption element to decrypt media
    protected using a specific system, it first needs all the
    protection system specific information necessary to acquire the decryption
    key(s) for that stream. The functions defined here enable this information
    to be passed in events from elements that extract it
    (e.g., ISOBMFF demuxers, MPEG DASH demuxers) to protection decrypter
    elements that use it.
    
    Events containing protection system specific information are created using
    #gst_event_new_protection, and they can be parsed by downstream elements
    using #gst_event_parse_protection.
    
    In Common Encryption, protection system specific information may be located

    boxes; it may also be contained in ContentProtection elements within MPEG
    DASH MPDs. The events created by #gst_event_new_protection contain data

  /**
      Allocate a new qos event with the given values.
    The QOS event is generated in an element that wants an upstream
    element to either reduce or increase its rate because of
    high/low CPU load or other resource usage such as network performance or
    throttling. Typically sinks generate these events for each buffer
    they receive.
    
    type indicates the reason for the QoS event. #GST_QOS_TYPE_OVERFLOW is
    used when a buffer arrived in time or when the sink cannot keep up with
    the upstream datarate. #GST_QOS_TYPE_UNDERFLOW is when the sink is not
    receiving buffers fast enough and thus has to drop late buffers.
    #GST_QOS_TYPE_THROTTLE is used when the datarate is artificially limited
    by the application, for example to reduce power consumption.
    
    proportion indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in the
    element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink). The value is
    generally computed based on more long term statistics about the streams
    timestamps compared to the clock.
    A value < 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster
    than real-time. A value > 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is not
    producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal proportion value. The
    proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of
    the element.
    
    diff is the difference against the clock in running time of the last
    buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event. A negative value
    means that the buffer with timestamp arrived in time. A positive value
    indicates how late the buffer with timestamp was. When throttling is
    enabled, diff will be set to the requested throttling interval.
    
    timestamp is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element
    to generate the QOS event. It is expressed in running time and thus an ever
    increasing value.
    
    The upstream element can use the diff and timestamp values to decide
    whether to process more buffers. For positive diff, all buffers with
    timestamp <= timestamp + diff will certainly arrive late in the sink
    as well. A (negative) diff value so that timestamp + diff would yield a
    result smaller than 0 is not allowed.
    
    The application can use general event probes to intercept the QoS
    event and implement custom application specific QoS handling.
    Params:
      type =       the QoS type
      proportion =       the proportion of the qos message

    A rate of 1.0 means normal playback rate, 2.0 means double speed.
    Negatives values means backwards playback. A value of 0.0 for the
    rate is not allowed and should be accomplished instead by PAUSING the
    pipeline.
    
    A pipeline has a default playback segment configured with a start
    position of 0, a stop position of -1 and a rate of 1.0. The currently
    configured playback segment can be queried with #GST_QUERY_SEGMENT.
    
    start_type and stop_type specify how to adjust the currently configured
    start and stop fields in playback segment. Adjustments can be made relative
    or absolute to the last configured values. A type of #GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE
    means that the position should not be updated.
    
    When the rate is positive and start has been updated, playback will start
    from the newly configured start position.
    
    For negative rates, playback will start from the newly configured stop

  /**
      Create a new SEGMENT event for segment. The segment event can only travel

    and playback properties for the buffers that will follow.
    
    The segment event marks the range of buffers to be processed. All
    data not within the segment range is not to be processed. This can be
    used intelligently by plugins to apply more efficient methods of skipping
    unneeded data. The valid range is expressed with the start and stop
    values.
    
    The time value of the segment is used in conjunction with the start
    value to convert the buffer timestamps into the stream time. This is
    usually done in sinks to report the current stream_time.
    time represents the stream_time of a buffer carrying a timestamp of
    start. time cannot be -1.
    
    start cannot be -1, stop can be -1. If there
    is a valid stop given, it must be greater or equal the start, including

    The applied_rate value provides information about any rate adjustment that
    has already been made to the timestamps and content on the buffers of the

    requested for playback. For example, if an element has an input segment
