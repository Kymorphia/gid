/**
    This helper structure holds the relevant values for tracking the region of
    interest in a media file, called a segment.
    
    The structure can be used for two purposes:
    
      $(LIST
          * performing seeks (handling seek events)
          * tracking playback regions (handling newsegment events)
      )
        
    The segment is usually configured by the application with a seek event which
    is propagated upstream and eventually handled by an element that performs the seek.
    
    The configured segment is then propagated back downstream with a newsegment event.
    This information is then used to clip media to the segment boundaries.
    
    A segment structure is initialized with [gst.segment.Segment.init_], which takes a #GstFormat
    that will be used as the format of the segment values. The segment will be configured
    with a start value of 0 and a stop/duration of -1, which is undefined. The default
    rate and applied_rate is 1.0.
    
    The public duration field contains the duration of the segment. When using
    the segment for seeking, the start and time members should normally be left
    to their default 0 value. The stop position is left to -1 unless explicitly
    configured to a different value after a seek event.
    
    The current position in the segment should be set by changing the position
    member in the structure.
    
    For elements that perform seeks, the current segment should be updated with the
    [gst.segment.Segment.doSeek] and the values from the seek event. This method will update
    all the segment fields. The position field will contain the new playback position.
    If the start_type was different from GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE, playback continues from
    the position position, possibly with updated flags or rate.
    
    For elements that want to use #GstSegment to track the playback region,
    update the segment fields with the information from the newsegment event.
    The [gst.segment.Segment.clip] method can be used to check and clip
    the media data to the segment boundaries.
    
    For elements that want to synchronize to the pipeline clock, [gst.segment.Segment.toRunningTime]
    can be used to convert a timestamp to a value that can be used to synchronize
    to the clock. This function takes into account the base as well as
    any rate or applied_rate conversions.
    
    For elements that need to perform operations on media data in stream_time,
    [gst.segment.Segment.toStreamTime] can be used to convert a timestamp and the segment
    info to stream time (which is always between 0 and the duration of the stream).
