/**
    This interface abstracts handling of property sets for elements with
    children. Imagine elements such as mixers or polyphonic generators. They all
    have multiple #GstPad or some kind of voice objects. Another use case are
    container elements like #GstBin.
    The element implementing the interface acts as a parent for those child
    objects.
    
    By implementing this interface the child properties can be accessed from the
    parent element by using [gst.child_proxy.ChildProxy.get] and [gst.child_proxy.ChildProxy.set].
    
    Property names are written as `child-name::property-name`. The whole naming
    scheme is recursive. Thus `child1::child2::property` is valid too, if
    `child1` and `child2` implement the #GstChildProxy interface.
