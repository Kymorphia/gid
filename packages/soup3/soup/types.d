/**
    Callback used by #SoupAuthDomainBasic for authentication purposes.
    
    The application should verify that username and password and valid
    and return true or false.
    
    If you are maintaining your own password database (rather than
    using the password to authenticate against some other system like
    PAM or a remote server), you should make sure you know what you are
    doing. In particular, don't store cleartext passwords, or
    easily-computed hashes of cleartext passwords, even if you don't
    care that much about the security of your server, because users
    will frequently use the same password for multiple sites, and so
    compromising any site with a cleartext (or easily-cracked) password
    database may give attackers access to other more-interesting sites
    as well.

    Params:
      domain = the domain
      msg = the message being authenticated
      username = the username provided by the client
      password = the password provided by the client
    Returns: true if username and password are valid
*/
alias AuthDomainBasicAuthCallback = bool delegate(soup.auth_domain_basic.AuthDomainBasic domain, soup.server_message.ServerMessage msg, string username, string password);

/**
    Callback used by #SoupAuthDomainDigest for authentication purposes.
    
    The application should look up username in its password database,
    and return the corresponding encoded password (see
    [soup.auth_domain_digest.AuthDomainDigest.encodePassword].

    Params:
      domain = the domain
      msg = the message being authenticated
      username = the username provided by the client
    Returns: the encoded password, or null if
        username is not a valid user. domain will free the password when
        it is done with it.

    [soup.auth_domain.AuthDomain.checkPassword], and use the return value from that method
    as its own return value.
    
    In general, for security reasons, it is preferable to use the
    auth-domain-specific auth callbacks (eg,
    `callbackAuthDomainBasicAuthCallback` and
    `callbackAuthDomainDigestAuthCallback`), because they don't require
    keeping a cleartext password database. Most users will use the same
    password for many different sites, meaning if any site with a
    cleartext password database is compromised, accounts on other
    servers might be compromised as well. For many of the cases where
    `classServer` is used, this is not really relevant, but it may still
    be worth considering.

    Params:
      domain = a #SoupAuthDomain
      msg = the #SoupServerMessage being authenticated
      username = the username from msg
    Returns: true if msg is authenticated, false if not.

    to print; the printer is expected to add a terminating newline.

/**
    A callback used to handle requests to a `classServer`.
    
    path and query contain the likewise-named components of the
    Request-URI, subject to certain assumptions. By default,
    `classServer` decodes all percent-encoding in the URI path, such that
    `"/foo`2Fbar`"` is treated the same as `"/foo/bar"`. If your
    server is serving resources in some non-POSIX-filesystem namespace,
    you may want to distinguish those as two distinct paths. In that
    case, you can set the `propertyServer:raw-paths` property when creating
    the `classServer`, and it will leave those characters undecoded.
    
    query contains the query component of the Request-URI parsed according to
    the rules for HTML form handling. Although this is the only commonly-used
    query string format in HTTP, there is nothing that actually requires that
    HTTP URIs use that format; if your server needs to use some other format, you
    can just ignore query, and call [soup.message.Message.getUri] and parse the URI's
    query field yourself.
    
    See [soup.server.Server.addHandler] and [soup.server.Server.addEarlyHandler]
    for details of what handlers can/should do.

    Params:
      server = the #SoupServer
