    #SoupMessageBody represents the request or response body of a
  `class@Message`.
  
  Note that while @length always reflects the full length of the
  message body, @data is normally null, and will only be filled in
  after [soup.message_body.MessageBody.flatten] is called. For client-side
  messages, this automatically happens for the response body after it
  has been fully read. Likewise, for server-side
  messages, the request body is automatically filled in after being
  read.
  
  As an added bonus, when @data is filled in, it is always terminated
  with a `\0` byte (which is not reflected in @length).
