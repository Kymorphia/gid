/**
    Contains metrics collected while loading a `class@Message` either from the
  network or the disk cache.
  
  Metrics are not collected by default for a `class@Message`, you need to add the
  flag [soup.types.MessageFlags.collectMetrics] to enable the feature.
  
  Temporal metrics are expressed as a monotonic time and always start with a
  fetch start event and finish with response end. All other events are optional.
  An event can be 0 because it hasn't happened yet, because it's optional or
  because the load failed before the event reached.
  
  Size metrics are expressed in bytes and are updated while the `class@Message` is
  being loaded. You can connect to different `class@Message` signals to get the
  final result of every value.
