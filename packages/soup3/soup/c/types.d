    Debug logging support
    
    #SoupLogger watches a `class@Session` and logs the HTTP traffic that
    it generates, for debugging purposes. Many applications use an
    environment variable to determine whether or not to use
    #SoupLogger, and to determine the amount of debugging output.
    
    To use #SoupLogger, first create a logger with [soup.logger.Logger.new_], optionally
    configure it with [soup.logger.Logger.setRequestFilter],
    [soup.logger.Logger.setResponseFilter], and [soup.logger.Logger.setPrinter], and
    then attach it to a session (or multiple sessions) with
    [soup.session.Session.addFeature].
    
    By default, the debugging output is sent to `stdout`, and looks something
    like:
    
    ```
    > POST /unauth HTTP/1.1
    > Soup-Debug-Timestamp: 1200171744
    > Soup-Debug: SoupSession 1 (0x612190), SoupMessage 1 (0x617000), GSocket 1 (0x612220)
    > Host: localhost
    > Content-Type: text/plain
    > Connection: close
    
    &lt; HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    &lt; Soup-Debug-Timestamp: 1200171744
    &lt; Soup-Debug: SoupMessage 1 (0x617000)
    &lt; Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2008 21:02:24 GMT
    &lt; Content-Length: 0
    ```
    
    The `Soup-Debug-Timestamp` line gives the time (as a `time_t`) when the
    request was sent, or the response fully received.
    
    The `Soup-Debug` line gives further debugging information about the
    `class@Session`, `class@Message`, and [gio.socket.Socket] involved; the hex
    numbers are the addresses of the objects in question (which may be useful if
    you are running in a debugger). The decimal IDs are simply counters that
    uniquely identify objects across the lifetime of the #SoupLogger. In
    particular, this can be used to identify when multiple messages are sent
    across the same connection.
    
    Currently, the request half of the message is logged just before
    the first byte of the request gets written to the network (from the
    `signal@Message::starting` signal).
    
    The response is logged just after the last byte of the response body is read
    from the network (from the `signal@Message::got-body` or
    `signal@Message::got-informational` signal), which means that the
    `signal@Message::got-headers` signal, and anything triggered off it (such as
    #SoupMessage::authenticate) will be emitted *before* the response headers are
    actually logged.
    
    If the response doesn't happen to trigger the `signal@Message::got-body` nor
    `signal@Message::got-informational` signals due to, for example, a
    cancellation before receiving the last byte of the response body, the
    response will still be logged on the event of the `signal@Message::finished`
    signal.

    A HTTP server.
    
    #SoupServer implements a simple HTTP server.
    
    To begin, create a server using [soup.server.Server.new_]. Add at least one
    handler by calling [soup.server.Server.addHandler] or
    [soup.server.Server.addEarlyHandler]; the handler will be called to
    process any requests underneath the path you pass. (If you want all
    requests to go to the same handler, just pass "/" (or null) for
    the path.)
    
    When a new connection is accepted (or a new request is started on
    an existing persistent connection), the #SoupServer will emit
    `signal@Server::request-started` and then begin processing the request
    as described below, but note that once the message is assigned a
    status-code, then callbacks after that point will be
    skipped. Note also that it is not defined when the callbacks happen
    relative to various `class@ServerMessage` signals.
    
    Once the headers have been read, #SoupServer will check if there is
    a `class@AuthDomain` `(qv)` covering the Request-URI; if so, and if the
    message does not contain suitable authorization, then the
    `class@AuthDomain` will set a status of [soup.types.Status.Unauthorized] on
    the message.
    
    After checking for authorization, #SoupServer will look for "early"
    handlers (added with [soup.server.Server.addEarlyHandler]) matching the
    Request-URI. If one is found, it will be run; in particular, this
    can be used to connect to signals to do a streaming read of the
    request body.
    
    (At this point, if the request headers contain `Expect:
    100-continue`, and a status code has been set, then
    #SoupServer will skip the remaining steps and return the response.
    If the request headers contain `Expect:
    100-continue` and no status code has been set,
    #SoupServer will return a [soup.types.Status.Continue] status before
    continuing.)
    
    The server will then read in the response body (if present). At
    this point, if there are no handlers at all defined for the
    Request-URI, then the server will return [soup.types.Status.NotFound] to
    the client.
    
    Otherwise (assuming no previous step assigned a status to the
    message) any "normal" handlers (added with
    [soup.server.Server.addHandler]) for the message's Request-URI will be
    run.
    
    Then, if the path has a WebSocket handler registered (and has
    not yet been assigned a status), #SoupServer will attempt to
    validate the WebSocket handshake, filling in the response and
    setting a status of [soup.types.Status.SwitchingProtocols] or
    [soup.types.Status.BadRequest] accordingly.
    
    If the message still has no status code at this point (and has not
    been paused with [soup.server_message.ServerMessage.pause]), then it will be
    given a status of [soup.types.Status.InternalServerError] (because at
    least one handler ran, but returned without assigning a status).
    
    Finally, the server will emit `signal@Server::request-finished` (or
    `signal@Server::request-aborted` if an I/O error occurred before
    handling was completed).
    
    If you want to handle the special "*" URI (eg, "OPTIONS *"), you
    must explicitly register a handler for "*"; the default handler
    will not be used for that case.
    
    If you want to process https connections in addition to (or instead
    of) http connections, you can set the `property@Server:tls-certificate`
    property.
    
    Once the server is set up, make one or more calls to
    [soup.server.Server.listen], [soup.server.Server.listenLocal], or
    [soup.server.Server.listenAll] to tell it where to listen for
    connections. (All ports on a #SoupServer use the same handlers; if
    you need to handle some ports differently, such as returning
    different data for http and https, you'll need to create multiple
    [soup.server.Server]s, or else check the passed-in URI in the handler
    function.).
    
    #SoupServer will begin processing connections as soon as you return
    to (or start) the main loop for the current thread-default
    [glib.main_context.MainContext].

    An HTTP server request and response pair.
    
    A SoupServerMessage represents an HTTP message that is being sent or
    received on a `class@Server`.
    
    `class@Server` will create [soup.server_message.ServerMessage]s automatically for
    incoming requests, which your application will receive via handlers.
    
    Note that libsoup's terminology here does not quite match the HTTP
    specification: in RFC 2616, an "HTTP-message" is *either* a Request, *or* a
    Response. In libsoup, a #SoupServerMessage combines both the request and the

    Soup session state object.
    
    #SoupSession is the object that controls client-side HTTP. A
    #SoupSession encapsulates all of the state that libsoup is keeping
    on behalf of your program; cached HTTP connections, authentication
    information, etc. It also keeps track of various global options
    and features that you are using.
    
    Most applications will only need a single #SoupSession; the primary
    reason you might need multiple sessions is if you need to have
    multiple independent authentication contexts. (Eg, you are
    connecting to a server and authenticating as two different users at
    different times; the easiest way to ensure that each `class@Message`
    is sent with the authentication information you intended is to use
    one session for the first user, and a second session for the other
    user.)
    
    Additional #SoupSession functionality is provided by
    `iface@SessionFeature` objects, which can be added to a session with
    [soup.session.Session.addFeature] or [soup.session.Session.addFeatureByType]
    For example, `class@Logger` provides support for
    logging HTTP traffic, `class@ContentDecoder` provides support for
    compressed response handling, and `class@ContentSniffer` provides
    support for HTML5-style response body content sniffing.
    Additionally, subtypes of `class@Auth` can be added
    as features, to add support for additional authentication types.
    
    All [soup.session.Session]s are created with a `class@AuthManager`, and support
    for `SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_BASIC` and `SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_DIGEST`. Additionally,
    sessions using the plain #SoupSession class (rather than one of its deprecated
    subtypes) have a `class@ContentDecoder` by default.
    
    Note that all async methods will invoke their callbacks on the thread-default
    context at the time of the function call.
