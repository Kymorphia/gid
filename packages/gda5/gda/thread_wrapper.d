      Connects a callback function to a signal for a particular object. The difference with g_signal_connect() and

       <listitem><para>if private_job and private_thread control in which case the signal is propagated.</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      Also note that signal handling is done asynchronously: when emitted in the worker thread, it
      will be "queued" to be processed in the user thread when it has the chance (when [gda.thread_wrapper.ThreadWrapper.iterate]
      is called directly or indirectly). The side effect is that the callback function is usually
      called long after the object emitting the signal has finished emitting it.
      
      To disconnect a signal handler, don't use any of the g_signal_handler_*() functions but the
      [gda.thread_wrapper.ThreadWrapper.disconnect] method.

        instance = the instance to connect to
        sigName = a string of the form "signal-name::detail"

             been emitted while in wrapper's private sub thread (ie. used when wrapper is executing some functions
             specified by [gda.thread_wrapper.ThreadWrapper.execute] or [gda.thread_wrapper.ThreadWrapper.executeVoid]), and to false if the
             callback is to be invoked whenever the signal is emitted, independently of the thread in which the
             signal is emitted.
        privateJob = set to true if callback is to be invoked only if the signal has
             been emitted when a job created for the calling thread is being executed, and to false
             if callback has to be called whenever the sig_name signal is emitted by instance. Note that
             this argument is not taken into account if private_thread is set to false.

      The returned #GIOChannel will have something to read everytime an execution job is finished

      function returns, and for signals which have been connected after this function returns. A safe
      practice is to call this function before the wrapper object has been used.
      
      Note2: this function will return the same #GIOChannel everytime it's called from the same thread.
      
      Note3: if the usage of the returned #GIOChannel reveals an error, then [glib.iochannel.IOChannel.shutdown] and
