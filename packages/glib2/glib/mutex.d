/**
    The #GMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a mutex
    (mutual exclusion). It can be used to protect data against shared
    access.
    
    Take for example the following function:
    ```c
      int
      give_me_next_number (void)
      {
        static int current_number = 0;
    
        // now do a very complicated calculation to calculate the new
        // number, this might for example be a random number generator
        current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
    
        return current_number;
      }
    ```
    It is easy to see that this won't work in a multi-threaded
    application. There current_number must be protected against shared
    access. A #GMutex can be used as a solution to this problem:
    ```c
      int
      give_me_next_number (void)
      {
        static GMutex mutex;
        static int current_number = 0;
        int ret_val;
    
        g_mutex_lock (&mutex);
        ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
        g_mutex_unlock (&mutex);
    
        return ret_val;
      }
    ```
    Notice that the #GMutex is not initialised to any particular value.
    Its placement in static storage ensures that it will be initialised
    to all-zeros, which is appropriate.
    
    If a #GMutex is placed in other contexts (eg: embedded in a struct)
    then it must be explicitly initialised using [glib.mutex.Mutex.init_].
    
    A #GMutex should only be accessed via g_mutex_ functions.

      It is not necessary to initialize a mutex that has been

      needed, use [glib.mutex.Mutex.clear].
