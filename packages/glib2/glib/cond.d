/**
    The #GCond struct is an opaque data structure that represents a
    condition. Threads can block on a #GCond if they find a certain
    condition to be false. If other threads change the state of this
    condition they signal the #GCond, and that causes the waiting
    threads to be woken up.
    
    Consider the following example of a shared variable.  One or more
    threads can wait for data to be published to the variable and when
    another thread publishes the data, it can signal one of the waiting
    threads to wake up to collect the data.
    
    Here is an example for using GCond to block a thread until a condition
    is satisfied:
    ```c
      gpointer current_data = NULL;
      GMutex data_mutex;
      GCond data_cond;
    
      void
      push_data (gpointer data)
      {
        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
        current_data = data;
        g_cond_signal (&data_cond);
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
      }
    
      gpointer
      pop_data (void)
      {
        gpointer data;
    
        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
        while (!current_data)
          g_cond_wait (&data_cond, &data_mutex);
        data = current_data;
        current_data = NULL;
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
    
        return data;
      }
    ```
    Whenever a thread calls pop_data() now, it will wait until
    current_data is non-null, i.e. until some other thread
    has called push_data().
    
    The example shows that use of a condition variable must always be
    paired with a mutex.  Without the use of a mutex, there would be a
    race between the check of @current_data by the while loop in
    pop_data() and waiting. Specifically, another thread could set
    @current_data after the check, and signal the cond (with nobody
    waiting on it) before the first thread goes to sleep. #GCond is
    specifically useful for its ability to release the mutex and go
    to sleep atomically.
    
    It is also important to use the [glib.cond.Cond.wait] and [glib.cond.Cond.waitUntil]
    functions only inside a loop which checks for the condition to be
    true.  See [glib.cond.Cond.wait] for an explanation of why the condition may
    not be true even after it returns.
    
    If a #GCond is allocated in static storage then it can be used
    without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call [glib.cond.Cond.init_]
    on it and [glib.cond.Cond.clear] when done.
    
    A #GCond should only be accessed via the g_cond_ functions.

  /**
      Atomically releases mutex and waits until cond is signalled.
      When this function returns, mutex is locked again and owned by the
      calling thread.
      
      When using condition variables, it is possible that a spurious wakeup
      may occur (ie: [glib.cond.Cond.wait] returns even though [glib.cond.Cond.signal] was
      not called).  It's also possible that a stolen wakeup may occur.
      This is when [glib.cond.Cond.signal] is called, but another thread acquires
      mutex before this thread and modifies the state of the program in
      such a way that when [glib.cond.Cond.wait] is able to return, the expected
      condition is no longer met.
      
      For this reason, [glib.cond.Cond.wait] must always be used in a loop.  See
      the documentation for #GCond for a complete example.

        mutex = a #GMutex that is currently locked

  /**
      Waits until either cond is signalled or end_time has passed.
      
      As with [glib.cond.Cond.wait] it is possible that a spurious or stolen wakeup
      could occur.  For that reason, waiting on a condition variable should
      always be in a loop, based on an explicitly-checked predicate.
      
      true is returned if the condition variable was signalled (or in the
      case of a spurious wakeup).  false is returned if end_time has
      passed.
      
      The following code shows how to correctly perform a timed wait on a
      condition variable (extending the example presented in the
      documentation for #GCond):
      
      ```c
      gpointer
      pop_data_timed (void)
      {
        gint64 end_time;
        gpointer data;
      
        g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
      
        end_time = g_get_monotonic_time () + 5 * G_TIME_SPAN_SECOND;
        while (!current_data)
          if (!g_cond_wait_until (&data_cond, &data_mutex, end_time))
            {
              // timeout has passed.
              g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
              return NULL;
            }
      
        // there is data for us
        data = current_data;
        current_data = NULL;
      
        g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
      
        return data;
      }
      ```
      
      Notice that the end time is calculated once, before entering the
      loop and reused.  This is the motivation behind the use of absolute
      time on this API -- if a relative time of 5 seconds were passed
      directly to the call and a spurious wakeup occurred, the program would
      have to start over waiting again (which would lead to a total wait
      time of more than 5 seconds).
  
      Params:
        mutex = a #GMutex that is currently locked
        endTime = the monotonic time to wait until
      Returns: true on a signal, false on a timeout
  */
  bool waitUntil(glib.mutex.Mutex mutex, long endTime)
  {
    bool _retval;
    _retval = g_cond_wait_until(cast(GCond*)this._cPtr, mutex ? cast(GMutex*)mutex._cPtr : null, endTime);
    return _retval;
  }
}
