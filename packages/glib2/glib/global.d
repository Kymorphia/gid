/**
    A wrapper for the POSIX access() function. This function is used to
    test a pathname for one or several of read, write or execute
    permissions, or just existence.
    
    On Windows, the file protection mechanism is not at all POSIX-like,
    and the underlying function in the C library only checks the
    FAT-style READONLY attribute, and does not look at the ACL of a
    file at all. This function is this in practise almost useless on
    Windows. Software that needs to handle file permissions on Windows
    more exactly should use the Win32 API.
    
    See your C library manual for more details about access().

    Params:
      filename = a pathname in the GLib file name encoding
            (UTF-8 on Windows)
      mode = as in access()
    Returns: zero if the pathname refers to an existing file system
          object that has all the tested permissions, or -1 otherwise
          or on error.

/**
    Sets a function to be called when the child indicated by pid
    exits, at the priority priority.
    
    If you obtain pid from [glib.global.spawnAsync] or [glib.global.spawnAsyncWithPipes]
    you will need to pass `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` as flag to
    the spawn function for the child watching to work.
    
    In many programs, you will want to call [glib.global.spawnCheckWaitStatus]
    in the callback to determine whether or not the child exited
    successfully.
    
    Also, note that on platforms where #GPid must be explicitly closed
    (see [glib.global.spawnClosePid]) pid must not be closed while the source
    is still active.  Typically, you should invoke [glib.global.spawnClosePid]
    in the callback function for the source.
    
    GLib supports only a single callback per process id.
    On POSIX platforms, the same restrictions mentioned for
    [glib.global.childWatchSourceNew] apply to this function.
    
    This internally creates a main loop source using
    [glib.global.childWatchSourceNew] and attaches it to the main loop context
    using [glib.source.Source.attach]. You can do these steps manually if you
    need greater control.

    Params:
      priority = the priority of the idle source. Typically this will be in the
          range between `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE` and `G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE`.

    The source will not initially be associated with any #GMainContext
    and must be added to one with [glib.source.Source.attach] before it will be
    executed.
    
    Note that child watch sources can only be used in conjunction with
    `g_spawn...` when the `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` flag is used.
    
    Note that on platforms where #GPid must be explicitly closed
    (see [glib.global.spawnClosePid]) pid must not be closed while the
    source is still active. Typically, you will want to call
    [glib.global.spawnClosePid] in the callback function for the source.
    
    On POSIX platforms, the following restrictions apply to this API
    due to limitations in POSIX process interfaces:
    
    $(LIST
      * pid must be a child of this process
      * pid must be positive
      * the application must not call `waitpid` with a non-positive
        first argument, for instance in another thread
      * the application must not wait for pid to exit by any other
        mechanism, including `waitpid(pid, ...)` or a second child-watch
        source for the same pid
      * the application must not ignore `SIGCHLD`
      * Before 2.78, the application could not send a signal (`kill()`) to the
        watched pid in a race free manner. Since 2.78, you can do that while the
        associated #GMainContext is acquired.
      * Before 2.78, even after destroying the #GSource, you could not
        be sure that pid wasn't already reaped. Hence, it was also not
        safe to `kill()` or `waitpid()` on the process ID after the child watch
        source was gone. Destroying the source before it fired made it
        impossible to reliably reap the process.
    )
      
    If any of those conditions are not met, this and related APIs will
    not work correctly. This can often be diagnosed via a GLib warning
    stating that `ECHILD` was received by `waitpid`.
    
    Calling `waitpid` for specific processes other than pid remains a
    valid thing to do.

/**
    A wrapper for the POSIX creat() function. The creat() function is

    On POSIX systems file descriptors are implemented by the operating
    system. On Windows, it's the C library that implements creat() and
    file descriptors. The actual Windows API for opening files is
    different, see MSDN documentation for CreateFile(). The Win32 API

    the file descriptor returned by this function makes sense only to
    functions in the same C library. Thus if the GLib-using code uses a

/**
    This function is a wrapper of dgettext() which does not translate
    the message if the default domain as set with textdomain() has no
    translations for the current locale.
    
    The advantage of using this function over dgettext() proper is that
    libraries using this function (like GTK) will not use translations
    if the application using the library does not have translations for
    the current locale.  This results in a consistent English-only
    interface instead of one having partial translations.  For this
    feature to work, the call to textdomain() and setlocale() should
    precede any [glib.global.dgettext] invocations.  For GTK, it means calling
    textdomain() before gtk_init or its variants.
    
    This function disables translations if and only if upon its first
    call all the following conditions hold:
    
    $(LIST
      * domain is not null
      
      * textdomain() has been called to set a default text domain
      
      * there is no translations available for the default text domain

      * current locale is not "C" or any English locales (those
        starting with "en_")
    )
      
    Note that this behavior may not be desired for example if an application
    has its untranslated messages in a language other than English. In those
    cases the application should call textdomain() after initializing GTK.
    
    Applications should normally not use this function directly,
    but use the _() macro for translations.

/**
    Writes all of contents to a file named filename, with good error checking.
    If a file called filename already exists it will be overwritten.
    
    flags control the properties of the write operation: whether it’s atomic,
    and what the tradeoff is between returning quickly or being resilient to
    system crashes.
    
    As this function performs file I/O, it is recommended to not call it anywhere
    where blocking would cause problems, such as in the main loop of a graphical
    application. In particular, if flags has any value other than
    `G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_NONE` then this function may call `fsync()`.
    
    If `G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT` is set in flags, the operation is atomic
    in the sense that it is first written to a temporary file which is then
    renamed to the final name.
    
    Notes:
    
    $(LIST
      * On UNIX, if filename already exists hard links to filename will break.
        Also since the file is recreated, existing permissions, access control
        lists, metadata etc. may be lost. If filename is a symbolic link,
        the link itself will be replaced, not the linked file.
      
      * On UNIX, if filename already exists and is non-empty, and if the system
        supports it (via a journalling filesystem or equivalent), and if
        `G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT` is set in flags, the `fsync()` call (or
        equivalent) will be used to ensure atomic replacement: filename
        will contain either its old contents or contents, even in the face of
        system power loss, the disk being unsafely removed, etc.
      
      * On UNIX, if filename does not already exist or is empty, there is a
        possibility that system power loss etc. after calling this function will
        leave filename empty or full of NUL bytes, depending on the underlying
        filesystem, unless `G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_DURABLE` and
        `G_FILE_SET_CONTENTS_CONSISTENT` are set in flags.
      
      * On Windows renaming a file will not remove an existing file with the
        new name, so on Windows there is a race condition between the existing
        file being removed and the temporary file being renamed.
      
      * On Windows there is no way to remove a file that is open to some
        process, or mapped into memory. Thus, this function will fail if
        filename already exists and is open.
    )
      
    If the call was successful, it returns true. If the call was not successful,
    it returns false and sets error. The error domain is `G_FILE_ERROR`.
    Possible error codes are those in the #GFileError enumeration.
    
    Note that the name for the temporary file is constructed by appending up
    to 7 characters to filename.
    
    If the file didn’t exist before and is created, it will be given the
    permissions from mode. Otherwise, the permissions of the existing file may
    be changed to mode depending on flags, or they may remain unchanged.

    Returns true if any of the tests in the bitfield test are

    will return true if the file exists; the check whether it's a
    directory doesn't matter since the existence test is true. With
    the current set of available tests, there's no point passing in
    more than one test at a time.
    
    Apart from `G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK` all tests follow symbolic links,
    so for a symbolic link to a regular file [glib.global.fileTest] will return
    true for both `G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK` and `G_FILE_TEST_IS_REGULAR`.
    
    Note, that for a dangling symbolic link [glib.global.fileTest] will return
    true for `G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK` and false for all other flags.
    
    You should never use [glib.global.fileTest] to test whether it is safe
    to perform an operation, because there is always the possibility
    of the condition changing before you actually perform the operation,
    see [TOCTOU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use).
    
    For example, you might think you could use `G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK`
    to know whether it is safe to write to a file without being
    tricked into writing into a different location. It doesn't work!
    
    ```c
     // DON'T DO THIS
     if (!g_file_test (filename, G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK))
       {
         fd = g_open (filename, O_WRONLY);
         // write to fd
       }
    
     // DO THIS INSTEAD
     fd = g_open (filename, O_WRONLY | O_NOFOLLOW | O_CLOEXEC);
     if (fd == -1)
       {
         // check error
         if (errno == ELOOP)
           // file is a symlink and can be ignored
         else
           // handle errors as before
       }
     else
       {
         // write to fd
       }
    ```
    
    Another thing to note is that `G_FILE_TEST_EXISTS` and
    `G_FILE_TEST_IS_EXECUTABLE` are implemented using the access()
    system call. This usually doesn't matter, but if your program
    is setuid or setgid it means that these tests will give you
    the answer for the real user ID and group ID, rather than the
    effective user ID and group ID.
    
    On Windows, there are no symlinks, so testing for
    `G_FILE_TEST_IS_SYMLINK` will always return false. Testing for
    `G_FILE_TEST_IS_EXECUTABLE` will just check that the file exists and
    its name indicates that it is executable, checking for well-known
    extensions and those listed in the `PATHEXT` environment variable.

    The default log handler set up by GLib; `funcGLib.log_set_default_handler`
    allows to install an alternate default log handler.
    
    This is used if no log handler has been set for the particular log
    domain and log level combination. It outputs the message to `stderr`
    or `stdout` and if the log level is fatal it calls `funcGLib.BREAKPOINT`. It automatically
    prints a new-line character after the message, so one does not need to be
    manually included in message.

            application.
          * `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG`: A space-separated list of log domains for
            which debug and informational messages are printed. By default
            these messages are not printed. If you need to set the allowed
            domains at runtime, use `funcGLib.log_writer_default_set_debug_domains`.

    a callback to a recursive call to [glib.main_context.MainContext.iteration],
    it returns 2. And so forth.
    
    This function is useful in a situation like the following:
    Imagine an extremely simple "garbage collected" system.
    
    ```c
    static GList *free_list;
    
    gpointer
    allocate_memory (gsize size)

    while (TRUE);
     {
       g_main_context_iteration (NULL, TRUE);
       free_allocated_memory();
      }
    ```
    
    This works from an application, however, if you want to do the same
    thing from a library, it gets more difficult, since you no longer
    control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle
    function to make the call to free_allocated_memory(), but that
    doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a
    recursive callback. This can be fixed by using [glib.global.mainDepth]
    
    ```c
    gpointer
    allocate_memory (gsize size)
    {
      FreeListBlock *block = g_new (FreeListBlock, 1);
      block->mem = g_malloc (size);
      block->depth = g_main_depth ();
      free_list = g_list_prepend (free_list, block);
      return block->mem;
    }
    
    void
    free_allocated_memory (void)
    {
      GList *l;
      
      int depth = g_main_depth ();
      for (l = free_list; l; );
        {
          GList *next = l->next;
          FreeListBlock *block = l->data;
          if (block->depth > depth)
            {
              g_free (block->mem);
              g_free (block);
              free_list = g_list_delete_link (free_list, l);
            }
                  
          l = next;
        }
      }
    ```
    
    There is a temptation to use [glib.global.mainDepth] to solve
    problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data
    to be received from the network in response to a menu item,
    the menu item might be selected again. It might seem that
    one could make the menu item's callback return immediately
    and do nothing if [glib.global.mainDepth] returns a value greater than 1.
    However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting
    the menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding
    these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many,
    many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the
    following techniques:
    
    1. Use [gtk.widget.Widget.setSensitive] or modal dialogs to prevent
       the user from interacting with elements while the main
       loop is recursing.
    
    2. Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle
       arbitrary  callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you
       simply return to the main loop and then get called again when
       there is more work to do.

/**
    Executes a child program asynchronously (your program will not
    block waiting for the child to exit).
    
    The child program is specified by the only argument that must be
    provided, argv. argv should be a null-terminated array of strings,
    to be passed as the argument vector for the child. The first string
    in argv is of course the name of the program to execute. By default,
    the name of the program must be a full path. If flags contains the
    `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` flag, the `PATH` environment variable is used to
    search for the executable. If flags contains the
    `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` flag, the `PATH` variable from envp
    is used to search for the executable. If both the
    `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` and `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` flags are
    set, the `PATH` variable from envp takes precedence over the
    environment variable.
    
    If the program name is not a full path and `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` flag
    is not used, then the program will be run from the current directory
    (or working_directory, if specified); this might be unexpected or even
    dangerous in some cases when the current directory is world-writable.
    
    On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
    this function and the other `g_spawn*()` functions are in UTF-8, the
    GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
    the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
    available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
    to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
    tools it is enough to make the program have a `wmain()` instead of
    `main()`. `wmain()` has a wide character argument vector as parameter.
    
    At least currently, mingw doesn't support `wmain()`, so if you use
    mingw to develop the spawned program, it should call
    g_win32_get_command_line() to get arguments in UTF-8.
    
    On Windows the low-level child process creation API `CreateProcess()`
    doesn't use argument vectors, but a command line. The C runtime
    library's `spawn*()` family of functions (which [glib.global.spawnAsyncWithPipes]
    eventually calls) paste the argument vector elements together into
    a command line, and the C runtime startup code does a corresponding
    reconstruction of an argument vector from the command line, to be
    passed to `main()`. Complications arise when you have argument vector
    elements that contain spaces or double quotes. The `spawn*()` functions
    don't do any quoting or escaping, but on the other hand the startup
    code does do unquoting and unescaping in order to enable receiving
    arguments with embedded spaces or double quotes. To work around this
    asymmetry, [glib.global.spawnAsyncWithPipes] will do quoting and escaping on
    argument vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
    `spawn()` function.
    
    The returned child_pid on Windows is a handle to the child
    process, not its identifier. Process handles and process
    identifiers are different concepts on Windows.
    
    envp is a null-terminated array of strings, where each string
    has the form `KEY=VALUE`. This will become the child's environment.
    If envp is null, the child inherits its parent's environment.
    
    flags should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
    function's behaviour. The `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` means that the
    child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a child watch
    ([glib.global.childWatchAdd]) to be notified about the death of the child process,
    otherwise it will stay around as a zombie process until this process exits.
    Eventually you must call [glib.global.spawnClosePid] on the child_pid, in order to
    free resources which may be associated with the child process. (On Unix,
    using a child watch is equivalent to calling waitpid() or handling
    the `SIGCHLD` signal manually. On Windows, calling [glib.global.spawnClosePid]
    is equivalent to calling `CloseHandle()` on the process handle returned
    in child_pid). See [glib.global.childWatchAdd].
    
    Open UNIX file descriptors marked as `FD_CLOEXEC` will be automatically
    closed in the child process. `G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN` means that
    other open file descriptors will be inherited by the child; otherwise all
    descriptors except stdin/stdout/stderr will be closed before calling `exec()`
    in the child. `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` means that argv[0] need not be an
    absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` environment
    variable. `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` means need not be an
    absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` variable from
    envp. If both `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH` and `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP`
    are used, the value from envp takes precedence over the environment.
    
    `G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN` means that the child will inherit the parent's
    standard input (by default, the child's standard input is attached to
    `/dev/null`). `G_SPAWN_STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL` explicitly imposes the default
    behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in both cases,
    the stdin_pipe_out argument is ignored.
    
    `G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL` means that the child's standard output
    will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
    standard output). `G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDOUT` explicitly imposes the
    default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
    both cases, the stdout_pipe_out argument is ignored.
    
    `G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL` means that the child's standard error
    will be discarded (by default, it goes to the same location as the parent's
    standard error). `G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDERR` explicitly imposes the
    default behavior. Both flags cannot be enabled at the same time and, in
    both cases, the stderr_pipe_out argument is ignored.
    
    It is valid to pass the same FD in multiple parameters (e.g. you can pass
    a single FD for both stdout_fd and stderr_fd, and include it in
    source_fds too).
    
    source_fds and target_fds allow zero or more FDs from this process to be
    remapped to different FDs in the spawned process. If n_fds is greater than
    zero, source_fds and target_fds must both be non-null and the same length.
    Each FD in source_fds is remapped to the FD number at the same index in
    target_fds. The source and target FD may be equal to simply propagate an FD
    to the spawned process. FD remappings are processed after standard FDs, so
    any target FDs which equal stdin_fd, stdout_fd or stderr_fd will overwrite
    them in the spawned process.
    
    source_fds is supported on Windows since 2.72.
    
    `G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO` means that the first element of argv is
    the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the actual
    argument vector to pass to the file. Normally [glib.global.spawnAsyncWithPipes]
    uses argv[0] as the file to execute, and passes all of argv to the child.
    
    child_setup and user_data are a function and user data. On POSIX
    platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
    performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
    pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling `exec()`.
    That is, child_setup is called just before calling `exec()` in the
    child. Obviously actions taken in this function will only affect
    the child, not the parent.
    
    On Windows, there is no separate `fork()` and `exec()` functionality.
    Child processes are created and run with a single API call,
    `CreateProcess()`. There is no sensible thing child_setup
    could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.
    
    If non-null, child_pid will on Unix be filled with the child's
    process ID. You can use the process ID to send signals to the child,
    or to use [glib.global.childWatchAdd] (or `waitpid()`) if you specified the
    `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` flag. On Windows, child_pid will be
    filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
    `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` flag. You can then access the child
    process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
    with the `WaitFor*()` functions, or examine its exit code with
    `GetExitCodeProcess()`. You should close the handle with `CloseHandle()`
    or [glib.global.spawnClosePid] when you no longer need it.
    
    If non-null, the stdin_pipe_out, stdout_pipe_out, stderr_pipe_out
    locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's
    standard input or reading from its standard output or standard error.
    The caller of [glib.global.spawnAsyncWithPipes] must close these file descriptors
    when they are no longer in use. If these parameters are null, the
    corresponding pipe won't be created.
    
    If stdin_pipe_out is null, the child's standard input is attached to
    `/dev/null` unless `G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN` is set.
    
    If stderr_pipe_out is NULL, the child's standard error goes to the same
    location as the parent's standard error unless `G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL`
    is set.
    
    If stdout_pipe_out is NULL, the child's standard output goes to the same
    location as the parent's standard output unless `G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL`
    is set.
    
    error can be null to ignore errors, or non-null to report errors.
    If an error is set, the function returns false. Errors are reported
    even if they occur in the child (for example if the executable in
    `argv[0]` is not found). Typically the `message` field of returned
    errors should be displayed to users. Possible errors are those from
    the `G_SPAWN_ERROR` domain.
    
    If an error occurs, child_pid, stdin_pipe_out, stdout_pipe_out,
    and stderr_pipe_out will not be filled with valid values.
    
    If child_pid is not null and an error does not occur then the returned
    process reference must be closed using [glib.global.spawnClosePid].
    
    On modern UNIX platforms, GLib can use an efficient process launching
    codepath driven internally by `posix_spawn()`. This has the advantage of
    avoiding the fork-time performance costs of cloning the parent process
    address space, and avoiding associated memory overcommit checks that are
    not relevant in the context of immediately executing a distinct process.
    This optimized codepath will be used provided that the following conditions
    are met:
    
    1. `G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD` is set
    2. `G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN` is set
    3. `G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP` is not set
    4. working_directory is null
    5. child_setup is null
    6. The program is of a recognised binary format, or has a shebang.
       Otherwise, GLib will have to execute the program through the
       shell, which is not done using the optimized codepath.
    
    If you are writing a GTK application, and the program you are spawning is a
    graphical application too, then to ensure that the spawned program opens its
    windows on the right screen, you may want to use #GdkAppLaunchContext,
    #GAppLaunchContext, or set the `DISPLAY` environment variable.

/**
    Set error if wait_status indicates the child exited abnormally
    (e.g. with a nonzero exit code, or via a fatal signal).
    
    The [glib.global.spawnSync] and [glib.global.childWatchAdd] family of APIs return the
    status of subprocesses encoded in a platform-specific way.
    On Unix, this is guaranteed to be in the same format waitpid() returns,
    and on Windows it is guaranteed to be the result of GetExitCodeProcess().
    
    Prior to the introduction of this function in GLib 2.34, interpreting
    wait_status required use of platform-specific APIs, which is problematic
    for software using GLib as a cross-platform layer.
    
    Additionally, many programs simply want to determine whether or not
    the child exited successfully, and either propagate a #GError or
    print a message to standard error. In that common case, this function
    can be used. Note that the error message in error will contain
    human-readable information about the wait status.
    
    The domain and code of error have special semantics in the case
    where the process has an "exit code", as opposed to being killed by
    a signal. On Unix, this happens if WIFEXITED() would be true of
    wait_status. On Windows, it is always the case.
    
    The special semantics are that the actual exit code will be the
    code set in error, and the domain will be `G_SPAWN_EXIT_ERROR`.
    This allows you to differentiate between different exit codes.
    
    If the process was terminated by some means other than an exit
    status (for example if it was killed by a signal), the domain will be
    `G_SPAWN_ERROR` and the code will be `G_SPAWN_ERROR_FAILED`.
    
    This function just offers convenience; you can of course also check
    the available platform via a macro such as `G_OS_UNIX`, and use
    WIFEXITED() and WEXITSTATUS() on wait_status directly. Do not attempt
    to scan or parse the error message string; it may be translated and/or
    change in future versions of GLib.
    
    Prior to version 2.70, [glib.global.spawnCheckExitStatus] provides the same
    functionality, although under a misleading name.

/**
    A wrapper for the POSIX stat() function. The stat() function

    the C library checks only the FAT-style READONLY attribute and does
    not look at the ACL at all. Thus on Windows the protection bits in
    the st_mode field are a fabrication of little use.
    
    On Windows the Microsoft C libraries have several variants of the

    In general, the tests and sub-suites within each suite are run in
    the order in which they are defined. However, note that prior to
    GLib 2.36, there was a bug in the `g_test_add_*`
    functions which caused them to create multiple suites with the same
    name, meaning that if you created tests "/foo/simple",
    "/bar/simple", and "/foo/using-bar" in that order, they would get
    run in that order (since [glib.global.testRun] would run the first "/foo"
    suite, then the "/bar" suite, then the second "/foo" suite). As of
    2.36, this bug is fixed, and adding the tests in that order would
    result in a running order of "/foo/simple", "/foo/using-bar",
    "/bar/simple". If this new ordering is sub-optimal (because it puts
    more-complicated tests before simpler ones, making it harder to
    figure out exactly what has failed), you can fix it by changing the
    test paths to group tests by suite in a way that will result in the
    desired running order. Eg, "/simple/foo", "/simple/bar",
    "/complex/foo-using-bar".
    
    However, you should never make the actual result of a test depend
    on the order that tests are run in. If you need to ensure that some
    particular code runs before or after a given test case, use
    g_test_add(), which lets you specify setup and teardown functions.
    
    If all tests are skipped or marked as incomplete (expected failures),
    this function will return 0 if producing TAP output, or 77 (treated

    Respawns the test program to run only test_path in a subprocess with the

    This can be used for a test case that might not return, or that
    might abort.
    
    If test_path is null then the same test is re-run in a subprocess.
    You can use [glib.global.testSubprocess] to determine whether the test is in
    a subprocess or not.
    
    test_path can also be the name of the parent test, followed by
    "`/subprocess/`" and then a name for the specific subtest (or just
    ending with "`/subprocess`" if the test only has one child test);
    tests with names of this form will automatically be skipped in the
    parent process.
    
    If envp is null, the parent process’ environment will be inherited.
    
    If usec_timeout is non-0, the test subprocess is aborted and
    considered failing if its run time exceeds it.
    
    The subprocess behavior can be configured with the
    #GTestSubprocessFlags flags.
    
    You can use methods such as g_test_trap_assert_passed(),
    g_test_trap_assert_failed(), and g_test_trap_assert_stderr() to
    check the results of the subprocess. (But note that
    g_test_trap_assert_stdout() and g_test_trap_assert_stderr()
    cannot be used if test_flags specifies that the child should
    inherit the parent stdout/stderr.)
    
    If your `main ()` needs to behave differently in
    the subprocess, you can call [glib.global.testSubprocess] (after calling
    [glib.global.testInit]) to see whether you are in a subprocess.
    
    Internally, this function tracks the child process using
    [glib.global.childWatchSourceNew], so your process must not ignore `SIGCHLD`, and
    must not attempt to watch or wait for the child process via another
    mechanism.

    Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other
    event sources. Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing.
    After each call to the timeout function, the time of the next
    timeout is recalculated based on the current time and the given interval

    The function is called repeatedly until it returns `G_SOURCE_REMOVE`
    or false, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and
    the function will not be called again.
    
    Unlike [glib.global.timeoutAdd], this function operates at whole second granularity.
    The initial starting point of the timer is determined by the implementation
    and the implementation is expected to group multiple timers together so that
    they fire all at the same time. To allow this grouping, the interval to the
    first timer is rounded and can deviate up to one second from the specified
    interval. Subsequent timer iterations will generally run at the specified
    interval.
    
    Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other
    event sources. Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing.
    After each call to the timeout function, the time of the next
    timeout is recalculated based on the current time and the given interval
    
    See [memory management of sources][mainloop-memory-management] for details
    on how to handle the return value and memory management of data.
    
    If you want timing more precise than whole seconds, use [glib.global.timeoutAdd]
    instead.
    
    The grouping of timers to fire at the same time results in a more power
    and CPU efficient behavior so if your timer is in multiples of seconds
    and you don't require the first timer exactly one second from now, the
    use of [glib.global.timeoutAddSeconds] is preferred over [glib.global.timeoutAdd].
