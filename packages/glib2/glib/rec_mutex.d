/**
    The GRecMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
  recursive mutex. It is similar to a #GMutex with the difference
  that it is possible to lock a GRecMutex multiple times in the same
  thread without deadlock. When doing so, care has to be taken to
  unlock the recursive mutex as often as it has been locked.
  
  If a #GRecMutex is allocated in static storage then it can be used
  without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
  [glib.rec_mutex.RecMutex.init_] on it and [glib.rec_mutex.RecMutex.clear] when done.
  
  A GRecMutex should only be accessed with the
  g_rec_mutex_ functions.
