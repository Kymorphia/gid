      Sets a #GSource to be dispatched when the given monotonic time is
      reached (or passed).  If the monotonic time is in the past (as it
      always will be if ready_time is 0) then the source will be
      dispatched immediately.
      
      If ready_time is -1 then the source is never woken up on the basis
      of the passage of time.
      
      Dispatching the source does not reset the ready time.  You should do
      so yourself, from the source dispatch function.
      
      Note that if you have a pair of sources where the ready time of one
      suggests that it will be delivered first but the priority for the
      other suggests that it would be delivered first, and the ready time
      for both sources is reached during the same main context iteration,
      then the order of dispatch is undefined.

      destroyed with [glib.source.Source.destroy].

      Do not call this API on a #GSource that you did not create.
