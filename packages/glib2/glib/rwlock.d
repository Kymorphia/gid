/**
    The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
    reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
    multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
    
    The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
    between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
    one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
    lock via [glib.rwlock.RWLock.writerLock]), multiple threads can gain
    simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
    [glib.rwlock.RWLock.readerLock]).
    
    It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
    lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
    it.
    
    Here is an example for an array with access functions:
    ```c
      GRWLock lock;
      GPtrArray *array;
    
      gpointer
      my_array_get (guint index)
      {
        gpointer retval = NULL;
    
        if (!array)
          return NULL;
    
        g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
        if (index < array->len)
          retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
        g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);
    
        return retval;
      }
    
      void
      my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
      {
        g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);
    
        if (!array)
          array = g_ptr_array_new ();
    
        if (index >= array->len)
          g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
        g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
    
        g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
      }
     ```
    This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
    (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
    (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed one at a time
    and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
    of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
    functions is fully multi-thread safe now.
    
    If a #GRWLock is allocated in static storage then it can be used
    without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
    [glib.rwlock.RWLock.init_] on it and [glib.rwlock.RWLock.clear] when done.
    
    A GRWLock should only be accessed with the g_rw_lock_ functions.

      necessary to initialise a reader-writer lock that has been statically
      allocated.
