  /**
      Acquires context and sets it as the thread-default context for the

      (such as most [gio][gio]-based I/O) which are
      started in this thread to run under context and deliver their
      results to its main loop, rather than running under the global
      default main context in the main thread. Note that calling this function
      changes the context returned by [glib.main_context.MainContext.getThreadDefault],
      not the one returned by [glib.main_context.MainContext.default_], so it does not affect
      the context used by functions like [glib.global.idleAdd].
      
      Normally you would call this function shortly after creating a new
      thread, passing it a #GMainContext which will be run by a
      #GMainLoop in that thread, to set a new default context for all
      async operations in that thread. In this case you may not need to
      ever call [glib.main_context.MainContext.popThreadDefault], assuming you want the
      new #GMainContext to be the default for the whole lifecycle of the
      thread.
      
      If you don't have control over how the new thread was created (e.g.
      in the new thread isn't newly created, or if the thread life
      cycle is managed by a #GThreadPool), it is always suggested to wrap
      the logic that needs to use the new #GMainContext inside a
      [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault] / [glib.main_context.MainContext.popThreadDefault]
      pair, otherwise threads that are re-used will end up never explicitly
      releasing the #GMainContext reference they hold.
      
      In some cases you may want to schedule a single operation in a
      non-default context, or temporarily use a non-default context in
      the main thread. In that case, you can wrap the call to the
      asynchronous operation inside a
      [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault] /
      [glib.main_context.MainContext.popThreadDefault] pair, but it is up to you to
      ensure that no other asynchronous operations accidentally get
      started while the non-default context is active.
      
      Beware that libraries that predate this function may not correctly
      handle being used from a thread with a thread-default context. Eg,
      see [gio.file.File.supportsThreadContexts].
