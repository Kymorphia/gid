/**
    The #GThread struct represents a running thread. This struct
    is returned by [glib.thread.Thread.new_] or [glib.thread.Thread.tryNew]. You can
    obtain the #GThread struct representing the current thread by
    calling [glib.thread.Thread.self].
    
    GThread is refcounted, see [glib.thread.Thread.ref_] and [glib.thread.Thread.unref].
    The thread represented by it holds a reference while it is running,
    and [glib.thread.Thread.join] consumes the reference that it is given, so
    it is normally not necessary to manage GThread references
    explicitly.
    
    The structure is opaque -- none of its fields may be directly
    accessed.

      This function creates a new thread. The new thread starts by invoking
      func with the argument data. The thread will run until func returns
      or until [glib.thread.Thread.exit] is called from the new thread. The return value
      of func becomes the return value of the thread, which can be obtained
      with [glib.thread.Thread.join].
      
      The name can be useful for discriminating threads in a debugger.
      It is not used for other purposes and does not have to be unique.
      Some systems restrict the length of name to 16 bytes.
      
      If the thread can not be created the program aborts. See
      [glib.thread.Thread.tryNew] if you want to attempt to deal with failures.
      
      If you are using threads to offload (potentially many) short-lived tasks,
      #GThreadPool may be more appropriate than manually spawning and tracking
      multiple #GThreads.
      
      To free the struct returned by this function, use [glib.thread.Thread.unref].
      Note that [glib.thread.Thread.join] implicitly unrefs the #GThread as well.
      
      New threads by default inherit their scheduler policy (POSIX) or thread
      priority (Windows) of the thread creating the new thread.
      
      This behaviour changed in GLib 2.64: before threads on Windows were not
      inheriting the thread priority but were spawned with the default priority.
      Starting with GLib 2.64 the behaviour is now consistent between Windows and
      POSIX and all threads inherit their parent thread's priority.
