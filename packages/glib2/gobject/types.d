    will never be finalized (they are artificially kept alive when their
    reference count drops to zero).

*/
alias ClassFinalizeFunc = void delegate(gobject.type_class.TypeClass gClass);

/**
    A callback function used by the type system to initialize the class
    of a specific type.
    
    This function should initialize all static class members.
    
    The initialization process of a class involves:
    
    $(LIST
      * Copying common members from the parent class over to the
        derived class structure.
      * Zero initialization of the remaining members not copied
        over from the parent class.
      * Invocation of the GBaseInitFunc() initializers of all parent
        types and the class' type.
      * Invocation of the class' GClassInitFunc() initializer.
    )
      
    Since derived classes are partially initialized through a memory copy
    of the parent class, the general rule is that GBaseInitFunc() and
    GBaseFinalizeFunc() should take care of necessary reinitialization
    and release of those class members that were introduced by the type
    that specified these GBaseInitFunc()/GBaseFinalizeFunc().
    GClassInitFunc() should only care about initializing static
    class members, while dynamic class members (such as allocated strings
    or reference counted resources) are better handled by a GBaseInitFunc()
    for this type, so proper initialization of the dynamic class members
    is performed for class initialization of derived types as well.
    
    An example may help to correspond the intend of the different class
    initializers:
    
    ```c
    typedef struct {
      GObjectClass parent_class;
      gint         static_integer;
      gchar       *dynamic_string;
    } TypeAClass;
    static void
    type_a_base_class_init (TypeAClass *class)
    {
      class->dynamic_string = g_strdup ("some string");
    }
    static void
    type_a_base_class_finalize (TypeAClass *class)
    {
      g_free (class->dynamic_string);
    }
    static void
    type_a_class_init (TypeAClass *class)
    {
      class->static_integer = 42;
    }
    
    typedef struct {
      TypeAClass   parent_class;
      gfloat       static_float;
      GString     *dynamic_gstring;
    } TypeBClass;
    static void
    type_b_base_class_init (TypeBClass *class)
    {
      class->dynamic_gstring = g_string_new ("some other string");
    }
    static void
    type_b_base_class_finalize (TypeBClass *class)
    {
      g_string_free (class->dynamic_gstring);
    }
    static void
    type_b_class_init (TypeBClass *class)
    {
      class->static_float = 3.14159265358979323846;
    }
    ```
    
    Initialization of TypeBClass will first cause initialization of
    TypeAClass (derived classes reference their parent classes, see
    [gobject.type_class.TypeClass.ref_] on this).
    
    Initialization of TypeAClass roughly involves zero-initializing its fields,
    then calling its GBaseInitFunc() type_a_base_class_init() to allocate
    its dynamic members (dynamic_string), and finally calling its GClassInitFunc()
    type_a_class_init() to initialize its static members (static_integer).
    The first step in the initialization process of TypeBClass is then
    a plain memory copy of the contents of TypeAClass into TypeBClass and
    zero-initialization of the remaining fields in TypeBClass.
    The dynamic members of TypeAClass within TypeBClass now need
    reinitialization which is performed by calling type_a_base_class_init()
    with an argument of TypeBClass.
    
    After that, the GBaseInitFunc() of TypeBClass, type_b_base_class_init()
    is called to allocate the dynamic members of TypeBClass (dynamic_gstring),
    and finally the GClassInitFunc() of TypeBClass, type_b_class_init(),
    is called to complete the initialization process with the static members
    (static_float).
    
    Corresponding finalization counter parts to the GBaseInitFunc() functions
    have to be provided to release allocated resources at class finalization
    time.

/**
    This function is responsible for converting the values collected from
    a variadic argument list into contents suitable for storage in a #GValue.
    
    This function should setup value similar to #GTypeValueInitFunc; e.g.
    for a string value that does not allow `NULL` pointers, it needs to either
    emit an error, or do an implicit conversion by storing an empty string.
    
    The value passed in to this function has a zero-filled data array, so
    just like for #GTypeValueInitFunc it is guaranteed to not contain any old
    contents that might need freeing.
    
    The n_collect_values argument is the string length of the `collect_format`
    field of #GTypeValueTable, and `collect_values` is an array of #GTypeCValue
    with length of n_collect_values, containing the collected values according
    to `collect_format`.
    
    The collect_flags argument provided as a hint by the caller. It may
    contain the flag `G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS` indicating that the collected
    value contents may be considered ‘static’ for the duration of the value
    lifetime. Thus an extra copy of the contents stored in collect_values is
    not required for assignment to value.
    
    For our above string example, we continue with:
    
    ```c
    if (!collect_values[0].v_pointer)
      value->data[0].v_pointer = g_strdup ("");
    else if (collect_flags & G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS)
      {
        value->data[0].v_pointer = collect_values[0].v_pointer;
        // keep a flag for the value_free() implementation to not free this string
        value->data[1].v_uint = G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS;
      }
    else
      value->data[0].v_pointer = g_strdup (collect_values[0].v_pointer);
    return NULL;
    ```
    
    It should be noted, that it is generally a bad idea to follow the
    `G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS` hint for reference counted types. Due to
    reentrancy requirements and reference count assertions performed
    by the signal emission code, reference counts should always be
    incremented for reference counted contents stored in the `value->data`
    array. To deviate from our string example for a moment, and taking
    a look at an exemplary implementation for `GTypeValueTable.collect_value()`
    of [gobject.object.ObjectWrap]:
    
    ```c
    GObject *object = G_OBJECT (collect_values[0].v_pointer);
    g_return_val_if_fail (object != NULL,
       g_strdup_printf ("Object %p passed as invalid NULL pointer", object));
    // never honour G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS for ref-counted types
    value->data[0].v_pointer = g_object_ref (object);
    return NULL;
    ```
    
    The reference count for valid objects is always incremented, regardless
    of `collect_flags`. For invalid objects, the example returns a newly
    allocated string without altering `value`.
    
    Upon success, `collect_value()` needs to return `NULL`. If, however,
    an error condition occurred, `collect_value()` should return a newly
    allocated string containing an error diagnostic.
    
    The calling code makes no assumptions about the `value` contents being
    valid upon error returns, `value` is simply thrown away without further
    freeing. As such, it is a good idea to not allocate [gobject.value.Value] contents
    prior to returning an error; however, `collect_values()` is not obliged
    to return a correctly setup value for error returns, simply because
    any non-`NULL` return is considered a fatal programming error, and
    further program behaviour is undefined.

    Params:
      value = the value to initialize
      collectValues = the collected values
      collectFlags = optional flags
    Returns: `NULL` on success, otherwise a
