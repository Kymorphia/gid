/**
    [rsvg.handle.Handle] loads an SVG document into memory.
    
    This is the main entry point into the librsvg library.  An [rsvg.handle.Handle] is an
    object that represents SVG data in memory.  Your program creates an
    [rsvg.handle.Handle] from an SVG file, or from a memory buffer that contains SVG data,
    or in the most general form, from a [gio.input_stream.InputStream] that will provide SVG data.
    
    Librsvg can load SVG images and render them to Cairo surfaces,
    using a mixture of SVG's [static mode] and [secure static mode].
    Librsvg does not do animation nor scripting, and can load
    references to external data only in some situations; see below.
    
    Librsvg supports reading [SVG 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) data, and is gradually
    adding support for features in [SVG 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/).  Librsvg also
    supports SVGZ files, which are just an SVG stream compressed with the GZIP algorithm.
    
    [static mode]: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/conform.html#static-mode
    [secure static mode]: https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/conform.html#secure-static-mode
    
    # The "base file" and resolving references to external files
    
    When you load an SVG, librsvg needs to know the location of the "base file"
    for it.  This is so that librsvg can determine the location of referenced
    entities.  For example, say you have an SVG in `/foo/bar/foo.svg`
    and that it has an image element like this:
    
    ```
    <image href="resources/foo.png" .../>
    ```
    
    In this case, librsvg needs to know the location of the toplevel
    `/foo/bar/foo.svg` so that it can generate the appropriate
    reference to `/foo/bar/resources/foo.png`.
    
    ## Security and locations of referenced files
    
    When processing an SVG, librsvg will only load referenced files if they are
    in the same directory as the base file, or in a subdirectory of it.  That is,
    if the base file is `/foo/bar/baz.svg`, then librsvg will
    only try to load referenced files (from SVG's
    `<image>` element, for example, or from content
    included through XML entities) if those files are in `/foo/bar/<anything>` or in `/foo/bar/<anything>\/.../<anything>`.
    This is so that malicious SVG files cannot include files that are in a directory above.
    
    The full set of rules for deciding which URLs may be loaded is as follows;
    they are applied in order.  A referenced URL will not be loaded as soon as
    one of these rules fails:
    
    1. All `data:` URLs may be loaded.  These are sometimes used
       to include raster image data, encoded as base-64, directly in an SVG file.
    
    2. URLs with queries ("?") or fragment identifiers ("#") are not allowed.
    
    3. All URL schemes other than data: in references require a base URL.  For
       example, this means that if you load an SVG with
       [rsvg.handle.Handle.newFromData] without calling [rsvg.handle.Handle.setBaseUri],
       then any referenced files will not be allowed (e.g. raster images to be
       loaded from other files will not work).
    
    4. If referenced URLs are absolute, rather than relative, then they must
       have the same scheme as the base URL.  For example, if the base URL has a
       `file` scheme, then all URL references inside the SVG must
       also have the `file` scheme, or be relative references which
       will be resolved against the base URL.
    
    5. If referenced URLs have a `resource` scheme, that is,
       if they are included into your binary program with GLib's resource
       mechanism, they are allowed to be loaded (provided that the base URL is
       also a `resource`, per the previous rule).
    
    6. Otherwise, non-`file` schemes are not allowed.  For
       example, librsvg will not load `http` resources, to keep
       malicious SVG data from "phoning home".
    
    7. A relative URL must resolve to the same directory as the base URL, or to
       one of its subdirectories.  Librsvg will canonicalize filenames, by
       removing ".." path components and resolving symbolic links, to decide whether
       files meet these conditions.
    
    # Loading an SVG with GIO
    
    This is the easiest and most resource-efficient way of loading SVG data into
    an [rsvg.handle.Handle].
    
    If you have a [gio.file.File] that stands for an SVG file, you can simply call
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.newFromGfileSync] to load an [rsvg.handle.Handle] from it.
    
    Alternatively, if you have a [gio.input_stream.InputStream], you can use
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.newFromStreamSync].
    
    Both of those methods allow specifying a [gio.cancellable.Cancellable], so the loading
    process can be cancelled from another thread.
    
    ## Loading an SVG from memory
    
    If you already have SVG data in a byte buffer in memory, you can create a
    memory input stream with [gio.memory_input_stream.MemoryInputStream.newFromData] and feed that
    to [rsvg.handle.Handle.newFromStreamSync].
    
    Note that in this case, it is important that you specify the base_file for
    the in-memory SVG data.  Librsvg uses the base_file to resolve links to
    external content, like raster images.
    
    # Loading an SVG without GIO
    
    You can load an [rsvg.handle.Handle] from a simple filename or URI with
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.newFromFile].  Note that this is a blocking operation; there
    is no way to cancel it if loading a remote URI takes a long time.  Also, note that
    this method does not let you specify [rsvg.types.HandleFlags].
    
    Otherwise, loading an SVG without GIO is not recommended, since librsvg will
    need to buffer your entire data internally before actually being able to
    parse it.  The deprecated way of doing this is by creating a handle with
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.new_] or [rsvg.handle.Handle.newWithFlags], and then using
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.write] and [rsvg.handle.Handle.close] to feed the handle with SVG data.
    Still, please try to use the GIO stream functions instead.
    
    # Resolution of the rendered image (dots per inch, or DPI)
    
    SVG images can contain dimensions like "`5cm`" or
    "`2pt`" that must be converted from physical units into
    device units.  To do this, librsvg needs to know the actual dots per inch
    (DPI) of your target device.  You can call [rsvg.handle.Handle.setDpi] or
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.setDpiXY] on an [rsvg.handle.Handle] to set the DPI before rendering
    it.
    
    # Rendering
    
    The preferred way to render a whole SVG document is to use
    [rsvg.handle.Handle.renderDocument].  Please see its documentation for
    details.
    
    # API ordering
    
    Due to the way the librsvg API evolved over time, an [rsvg.handle.Handle] object is available
    for use as soon as it is constructed.  However, not all of its methods can be
    called at any time.  For example, an [rsvg.handle.Handle] just constructed with [rsvg.handle.Handle.new_]
    is not loaded yet, and it does not make sense to call [rsvg.handle.Handle.renderDocument] on it
    just at that point.
    
    The documentation for the available methods in [rsvg.handle.Handle] may mention that a particular
    method is only callable on a "fully loaded handle".  This means either:
    
    $(LIST
      * The handle was loaded with [rsvg.handle.Handle.write] and [rsvg.handle.Handle.close], and
        those functions returned no errors.
      
      * The handle was loaded with [rsvg.handle.Handle.readStreamSync] and that function
        returned no errors.
    )
      
    Before librsvg 2.46, the library did not fully verify that a handle was in a
    fully loaded state for the methods that require it.  To preserve
    compatibility with old code which inadvertently called the API without
    checking for errors, or which called some methods outside of the expected
    order, librsvg will just emit a `g_critical()` message in those cases.
    
    New methods introduced in librsvg 2.46 and later will check for the correct
    ordering, and panic if they are called out of order.  This will abort
    the program as if it had a failed assertion.
