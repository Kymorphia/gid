    #GstNetClientClock implements a custom #GstClock that synchronizes its time
  to a remote time provider such as #GstNetTimeProvider. #GstNtpClock
  implements a #GstClock that synchronizes its time to a remote NTPv4 server.
  
  A new clock is created with [gstnet.net_client_clock.NetClientClock.new_] or
  [gstnet.ntp_clock.NtpClock.new_], which takes the address and port of the remote time
  provider along with a name and an initial time.
  
  This clock will poll the time provider and will update its calibration
  parameters based on the local and remote observations.
  
  The "round-trip" property limits the maximum round trip packets can take.
  
  Various parameters of the clock can be configured with the parent #GstClock
  "timeout", "window-size" and "window-threshold" object properties.
  
  A #GstNetClientClock and #GstNtpClock is typically set on a #GstPipeline with
  [gst.pipeline.Pipeline.useClock].
  
  If you set a #GstBus on the clock via the "bus" object property, it will
  send @GST_MESSAGE_ELEMENT messages with an attached #GstStructure containing
  statistics about clock accuracy and network traffic.

    GstPtpClock implements a PTP (IEEE1588:2008) ordinary clock in slave-only
  mode, that allows a GStreamer pipeline to synchronize to a PTP network
  clock in some specific domain.
  
  The PTP subsystem can be initialized with [gstnet.global.ptpInit], which then starts
  a helper process to do the actual communication via the PTP ports. This is
  required as PTP listens on ports < 1024 and thus requires special
  privileges. Once this helper process is started, the main process will
  synchronize to all PTP domains that are detected on the selected
  interfaces.
  
  [gstnet.ptp_clock.PtpClock.new_] then allows to create a GstClock that provides the PTP
  time from a master clock inside a specific PTP domain. This clock will only
  return valid timestamps once the timestamps in the PTP domain are known. To
  check this, you can use [gst.clock.Clock.waitForSync], the GstClock::synced
  signal and [gst.clock.Clock.isSynced].
  
  To gather statistics about the PTP clock synchronization,
  [gstnet.global.ptpStatisticsCallbackAdd] can be used. This gives the application
  the possibility to collect all kinds of statistics from the clock
  synchronization.
