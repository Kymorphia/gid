    [adw.clamp_layout.ClampLayout] constraints the size of the widgets it contains to a given
    maximum size. It will constrain the width if it is horizontal, or the height
    if it is vertical. The expansion of the children from their minimum to their
    maximum size is eased out for a smooth transition.
    
    If a child requires more than the requested maximum size, it will be
    allocated the minimum size it can fit in instead.
    
    [adw.clamp_layout.ClampLayout] can scale with the text scale factor, use the
    `property@ClampLayout:unit` property to enable that behavior.
    
    See also: `class@Clamp`, `class@ClampScrollable`.
