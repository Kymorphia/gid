/**
    A [gsk.glshader.GLShader] is a snippet of GLSL that is meant to run in the
  fragment shader of the rendering pipeline.
  
  A fragment shader gets the coordinates being rendered as input and
  produces the pixel values for that particular pixel. Additionally,
  the shader can declare a set of other input arguments, called
  uniforms (as they are uniform over all the calls to your shader in
  each instance of use). A shader can also receive up to 4
  textures that it can use as input when producing the pixel data.
  
  [gsk.glshader.GLShader] is usually used with [gtk.snapshot.Snapshot.pushGlShader]
  to produce a [gsk.glshader_node.GLShaderNode] in the rendering hierarchy,
  and then its input textures are constructed by rendering the child
  nodes to textures before rendering the shader node itself. (You can
  pass texture nodes as children if you want to directly use a texture
  as input).
  
  The actual shader code is GLSL code that gets combined with
  some other code into the fragment shader. Since the exact
  capabilities of the GPU driver differs between different OpenGL
  drivers and hardware, GTK adds some defines that you can use
  to ensure your GLSL code runs on as many drivers as it can.
  
  If the OpenGL driver is GLES, then the shader language version
  is set to 100, and GSK_GLES will be defined in the shader.
  
  Otherwise, if the OpenGL driver does not support the 3.2 core profile,
  then the shader will run with language version 110 for GL2 and 130 for GL3,
  and GSK_LEGACY will be defined in the shader.
  
  If the OpenGL driver supports the 3.2 code profile, it will be used,
  the shader language version is set to 150, and GSK_GL3 will be defined
  in the shader.
  
  The main function the shader must implement is:
  
  ```glsl
   void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
                  in vec2 fragCoord,
                  in vec2 resolution,
                  in vec2 uv)
  ```
  
  Where the input @fragCoord is the coordinate of the pixel we're
  currently rendering, relative to the boundary rectangle that was
  specified in the [gsk.glshader_node.GLShaderNode], and @resolution is the width and
  height of that rectangle. This is in the typical GTK coordinate
  system with the origin in the top left. @uv contains the u and v
  coordinates that can be used to index a texture at the
  corresponding point. These coordinates are in the [0..1]x[0..1]
  region, with 0, 0 being in the lower left corder (which is typical
  for OpenGL).
  
  The output @fragColor should be a RGBA color (with
  premultiplied alpha) that will be used as the output for the
  specified pixel location. Note that this output will be
  automatically clipped to the clip region of the glshader node.
  
  In addition to the function arguments the shader can define
  up to 4 uniforms for textures which must be called u_textureN
  (i.e. u_texture1 to u_texture4) as well as any custom uniforms
  you want of types int, uint, bool, float, vec2, vec3 or vec4.
  
  All textures sources contain premultiplied alpha colors, but if some
  there are outer sources of colors there is a gsk_premultiply() helper
  to compute premultiplication when needed.
  
  Note that GTK parses the uniform declarations, so each uniform has to
  be on a line by itself with no other code, like so:
  
  ```glsl
  uniform float u_time;
  uniform vec3 u_color;
  uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
  uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
  ```
  
  GTK uses the "gsk" namespace in the symbols it uses in the
  shader, so your code should not use any symbols with the prefix gsk
  or GSK. There are some helper functions declared that you can use:
  
  ```glsl
  vec4 GskTexture(sampler2D sampler, vec2 texCoords);
  ```
  
  This samples a texture (e.g. u_texture1) at the specified
  coordinates, and contains some helper ifdefs to ensure that
  it works on all OpenGL versions.
  
  You can compile the shader yourself using [gsk.glshader.GLShader.compile],
  otherwise the GSK renderer will do it when it handling the glshader
  node. If errors occurs, the returned @error will include the glsl
  sources, so you can see what GSK was passing to the compiler. You
  can also set GSK_DEBUG=shaders in the environment to see the sources
  and other relevant information about all shaders that GSK is handling.
  
  # An example shader
  
  ```glsl
  uniform float position;
  uniform sampler2D u_texture1;
  uniform sampler2D u_texture2;
  
  void mainImage(out vec4 fragColor,
                 in vec2 fragCoord,
                 in vec2 resolution,
                 in vec2 uv) {
    vec4 source1 = GskTexture(u_texture1, uv);
    vec4 source2 = GskTexture(u_texture2, uv);
  
    fragColor = position * source1 + (1.0 - position) * source2;
  }
  ```

    A [gsk.path.Path] describes lines and curves that are more complex
  than simple rectangles.
  
  Paths can used for rendering (filling or stroking) and for animations
  (e.g. as trajectories).
  
  [gsk.path.Path] is an immutable, opaque, reference-counted struct.
  After creation, you cannot change the types it represents. Instead,
  new [gsk.path.Path] objects have to be created. The [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder]
  structure is meant to help in this endeavor.
  
  Conceptually, a path consists of zero or more contours (continuous, connected
  curves), each of which may or may not be closed. Contours are typically
  constructed from BÃ©zier segments.

/**
    [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder] is an auxiliary object for constructing

  ```c
  GskPath *
  construct_path (void)
  {
    GskPathBuilder *builder;
  
    builder = gsk_path_builder_new ();
  
    // add contours to the path here
  
    return gsk_path_builder_free_to_path (builder);
  ```
  
  Adding contours to the path can be done in two ways.
  The easiest option is to use the `gsk_path_builder_add_*` group
  of functions that add predefined contours to the current path,
  either common shapes like [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder.addCircle]
  or by adding from other paths like [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder.addPath].
  
  The `gsk_path_builder_add_*` methods always add complete contours,
  and do not use or modify the current point.
  
  The other option is to define each line and curve manually with
  the `gsk_path_builder_*_to` group of functions. You start with
  a call to [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder.moveTo] to set the starting point
  and then use multiple calls to any of the drawing functions to
  move the pen along the plane. Once you are done, you can call
  [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder.close] to close the path by connecting it
  back with a line to the starting point.
  
  This is similar to how paths are drawn in Cairo.
  
  Note that [gsk.path_builder.PathBuilder] will reduce the degree of added BÃ©zier
  curves as much as possible, to simplify rendering.
