/**
    This class is for elements that receive buffers in an undesired size.
    While for example raw video contains one image per buffer, the same is not
    true for a lot of other formats, especially those that come directly from
    a file. So if you have undefined buffer sizes and require a specific size,
    this object is for you.
    
    An adapter is created with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.new_]. It can be freed again with
    [gobject.object.ObjectG.unref].
    
    The theory of operation is like this: All buffers received are put
    into the adapter using [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.push] and the data is then read back
    in chunks of the desired size using [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.map]/[gstbase.adapter.Adapter.unmap]
    and/or [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.copy]. After the data has been processed, it is freed
    using [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.unmap].
    
    Other methods such as [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.take] and [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.takeBuffer]
    combine [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.map] and [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.unmap] in one method and are
    potentially more convenient for some use cases.
    
    For example, a sink pad's chain function that needs to pass data to a library
    in 512-byte chunks could be implemented like this:
    ```c
    static GstFlowReturn
    sink_pad_chain (GstPad *pad, GstObject *parent, GstBuffer *buffer)
    {
      MyElement *this;
      GstAdapter *adapter;
      GstFlowReturn ret = GST_FLOW_OK;
    
      this = MY_ELEMENT (parent);
    
      adapter = this->adapter;
    
      // put buffer into adapter
      gst_adapter_push (adapter, buffer);
    
      // while we can read out 512 bytes, process them
      while (gst_adapter_available (adapter) >= 512 && ret == GST_FLOW_OK) {
        const guint8 *data = gst_adapter_map (adapter, 512);
        // use flowreturn as an error value
        ret = my_library_foo (data);
        gst_adapter_unmap (adapter);
        gst_adapter_flush (adapter, 512);
      }
      return ret;
    }
    ```
    
    For another example, a simple element inside GStreamer that uses #GstAdapter
    is the libvisual element.
    
    An element using #GstAdapter in its sink pad chain function should ensure that
    when the FLUSH_STOP event is received, that any queued data is cleared using
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.clear]. Data should also be cleared or processed on EOS and
    when changing state from [gst.types.State.Paused] to [gst.types.State.Ready].
    
    Also check the GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DISCONT flag on the buffer. Some elements might
    need to clear the adapter after a discontinuity.
    
    The adapter will keep track of the timestamps of the buffers
    that were pushed. The last seen timestamp before the current position
    can be queried with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.prevPts]. This function can
    optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer that
    carried the timestamp and the current adapter position. The distance is
    useful when dealing with, for example, raw audio samples because it allows
    you to calculate the timestamp of the current adapter position by using the
    last seen timestamp and the amount of bytes since.  Additionally, the
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.prevPtsAtOffset] can be used to determine the last
    seen timestamp at a particular offset in the adapter.
    
    The adapter will also keep track of the offset of the buffers
    (#GST_BUFFER_OFFSET) that were pushed. The last seen offset before the
    current position can be queried with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.prevOffset]. This function
    can optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer
    that carried the offset and the current adapter position.
    
    Additionally the adapter also keeps track of the PTS, DTS and buffer offset
    at the last discontinuity, which can be retrieved with
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.ptsAtDiscont], [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.dtsAtDiscont] and
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.offsetAtDiscont]. The number of bytes that were consumed
    since then can be queried with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.distanceFromDiscont].
    
    A last thing to note is that while #GstAdapter is pretty optimized,
    merging buffers still might be an operation that requires a `malloc()` and
    `memcpy()` operation, and these operations are not the fastest. Because of
    this, some functions like [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.availableFast] are provided to help
    speed up such cases should you want to. To avoid repeated memory allocations,
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.copy] can be used to copy data into a (statically allocated)
    user provided buffer.
    
    #GstAdapter is not MT safe. All operations on an adapter must be serialized by
    the caller. This is not normally a problem, however, as the normal use case
    of #GstAdapter is inside one pad's chain function, in which case access is
    serialized via the pad's STREAM_LOCK.
    
    Note that [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.push] takes ownership of the buffer passed. Use
    gst_buffer_ref() before pushing it into the adapter if you still want to
    access the buffer later. The adapter will never modify the data in the
    buffer pushed in it.

/**
    Manages a set of pads with the purpose of aggregating their buffers.
    Control is given to the subclass when all pads have data.
    
     $(LIST
        * Base class for mixers and muxers. Subclasses should at least implement
          the #GstAggregatorClass::aggregate virtual method.
       
        * Installs a #GstPadChainFunction, a #GstPadEventFullFunction and a
          #GstPadQueryFunction to queue all serialized data packets per sink pad.
          Subclasses should not overwrite those, but instead implement
          #GstAggregatorClass::sink_event and #GstAggregatorClass::sink_query as
          needed.
       
        * When data is queued on all pads, the aggregate vmethod is called.
       
        * One can peek at the data on any given GstAggregatorPad with the
          [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.peekBuffer] method, and remove it from the pad
          with the gst_aggregator_pad_pop_buffer () method. When a buffer
          has been taken with pop_buffer (), a new buffer can be queued
          on that pad.
       
        * When [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.peekBuffer] or [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.hasBuffer]
          are called, a reference is taken to the returned buffer, which stays
          valid until either:
       
            - [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.popBuffer] is called, in which case the caller
              is guaranteed that the buffer they receive is the same as the peeked
              buffer.
            - [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.dropBuffer] is called, in which case the caller
              is guaranteed that the dropped buffer is the one that was peeked.
            - the subclass implementation of #GstAggregatorClass.aggregate returns.
       
          Subsequent calls to [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.peekBuffer] or
          [gstbase.aggregator_pad.AggregatorPad.hasBuffer] return / check the same buffer that was
          returned / checked, until one of the conditions listed above is met.
       
          Subclasses are only allowed to call these methods from the aggregate
          thread.
       
        * If the subclass wishes to push a buffer downstream in its aggregate
          implementation, it should do so through the
          [gstbase.aggregator.Aggregator.finishBuffer] method. This method will take care
          of sending and ordering mandatory events such as stream start, caps
          and segment. Buffer lists can also be pushed out with
          [gstbase.aggregator.Aggregator.finishBufferList].
       
        * Same goes for EOS events, which should not be pushed directly by the
          subclass, it should instead return GST_FLOW_EOS in its aggregate
          implementation.
       
        * Note that the aggregator logic regarding gap event handling is to turn
          these into gap buffers with matching PTS and duration. It will also
          flag these buffers with GST_BUFFER_FLAG_GAP and GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DROPPABLE
          to ease their identification and subsequent processing.
          In addition, if the gap event was flagged with GST_GAP_FLAG_MISSING_DATA,
          a custom meta is added to the resulting gap buffer (GstAggregatorMissingDataMeta).
       
        * Subclasses must use (a subclass of) #GstAggregatorPad for both their
          sink and source pads.
          See [gst.element_class.ElementClass.addStaticPadTemplateWithGtype].

    This base class is for parser elements that process data and splits it
    into separate audio/video/whatever frames.
    
    It provides for:
    
      $(LIST
          * provides one sink pad and one source pad
          * handles state changes
          * can operate in pull mode or push mode
          * handles seeking in both modes
          * handles events (SEGMENT/EOS/FLUSH)
          * handles queries (POSITION/DURATION/SEEKING/FORMAT/CONVERT)
          * handles flushing
      )
        
    The purpose of this base class is to provide the basic functionality of
    a parser and share a lot of rather complex code.
    
    # Description of the parsing mechanism:
    
    ## Set-up phase
    
     $(LIST
        * #GstBaseParse calls #GstBaseParseClass::start to inform subclass
          that data processing is about to start now.
       
        * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass::set_sink_caps to
          inform the subclass about incoming sinkpad caps. Subclass could
          already set the srcpad caps accordingly, but this might be delayed
          until calling [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.finishFrame] with a non-queued frame.
       
        * At least at this point subclass needs to tell the #GstBaseParse class
          how big data chunks it wants to receive (minimum frame size ). It can
          do this with [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setMinFrameSize].
       
        * #GstBaseParse class sets up appropriate data passing mode (pull/push)
          and starts to process the data.
     )
       
    ## Parsing phase
    
     $(LIST
        * #GstBaseParse gathers at least min_frame_size bytes of data either
          by pulling it from upstream or collecting buffers in an internal
          #GstAdapter.
       
        * A buffer of (at least) min_frame_size bytes is passed to subclass
          with #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame. Subclass checks the contents
          and can optionally return #GST_FLOW_OK along with an amount of data
          to be skipped to find a valid frame (which will result in a
          subsequent DISCONT).  If, otherwise, the buffer does not hold a
          complete frame, #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame can merely return
          and will be called again when additional data is available.  In push
          mode this amounts to an additional input buffer (thus minimal
          additional latency), in pull mode this amounts to some arbitrary
          reasonable buffer size increase.
       
          Of course, [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setMinFrameSize] could also be used if
          a very specific known amount of additional data is required.  If,
          however, the buffer holds a complete valid frame, it can pass the
          size of this frame to [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.finishFrame].
       
          If acting as a converter, it can also merely indicate consumed input
          data while simultaneously providing custom output data.  Note that
          baseclass performs some processing (such as tracking overall consumed
          data rate versus duration) for each finished frame, but other state
          is only updated upon each call to #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame
          (such as tracking upstream input timestamp).
       
          Subclass is also responsible for setting the buffer metadata
          (e.g. buffer timestamp and duration, or keyframe if applicable).
          (although the latter can also be done by #GstBaseParse if it is
          appropriately configured, see below).  Frame is provided with
          timestamp derived from upstream (as much as generally possible),
          duration obtained from configuration (see below), and offset
          if meaningful (in pull mode).
       
          Note that #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame might receive any small
          amount of input data when leftover data is being drained (e.g. at
          EOS).
       
        * As part of finish frame processing, just prior to actually pushing
          the buffer in question, it is passed to
          #GstBaseParseClass::pre_push_frame which gives subclass yet one last
          chance to examine buffer metadata, or to send some custom (tag)
          events, or to perform custom (segment) filtering.
       
        * During the parsing process #GstBaseParseClass will handle both srcpad
          and sinkpad events. They will be passed to subclass if
          #GstBaseParseClass::sink_event or #GstBaseParseClass::src_event
          implementations have been provided.
     )
       
    ## Shutdown phase
    
    $(LIST
      * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass::stop to inform the
        subclass that data parsing will be stopped.
    )
      
    Subclass is responsible for providing pad template caps for source and
    sink pads. The pads need to be named "sink" and "src". It also needs to
    set the fixed caps on srcpad, when the format is ensured (e.g.  when
    base class calls subclass' #GstBaseParseClass::set_sink_caps function).
    
    This base class uses [gst.types.Format.Default] as a meaning of frames. So,
    subclass conversion routine needs to know that conversion from
    [gst.types.Format.Time] to [gst.types.Format.Default] must return the
    frame number that can be found from the given byte position.
    
    #GstBaseParse uses subclasses conversion methods also for seeking (or
    otherwise uses its own default one, see also below).
    
    Subclass @start and @stop functions will be called to inform the beginning
    and end of data processing.
    
    Things that subclass need to take care of:
    
    $(LIST
      * Provide pad templates
      * Fixate the source pad caps when appropriate
      * Inform base class how big data chunks should be retrieved. This is
        done with [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setMinFrameSize] function.
      * Examine data chunks passed to subclass with
        #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame and pass proper frame(s) to
        [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.finishFrame], and setting src pad caps and timestamps
        on frame.
      * Provide conversion functions
      * Update the duration information with [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setDuration]
      * Optionally passthrough using [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setPassthrough]
      * Configure various baseparse parameters using
        [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setAverageBitrate], [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setSyncable]
        and [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setFrameRate].
      
      * In particular, if subclass is unable to determine a duration, but
        parsing (or specs) yields a frames per seconds rate, then this can be
        provided to #GstBaseParse to enable it to cater for buffer time
        metadata (which will be taken from upstream as much as
        possible). Internally keeping track of frame durations and respective
        sizes that have been pushed provides #GstBaseParse with an estimated
        bitrate. A default #GstBaseParseClass::convert (used if not
        overridden) will then use these rates to perform obvious conversions.
        These rates are also used to update (estimated) duration at regular
        frame intervals.

/**
    #GstBaseSink is the base class for sink elements in GStreamer, such as
    xvimagesink or filesink. It is a layer on top of #GstElement that provides a
    simplified interface to plugin writers. #GstBaseSink handles many details
    for you, for example: preroll, clock synchronization, state changes,
    activation in push or pull mode, and queries.
    
    In most cases, when writing sink elements, there is no need to implement
    class methods from #GstElement or to set functions on pads, because the
    #GstBaseSink infrastructure should be sufficient.
    
    #GstBaseSink provides support for exactly one sink pad, which should be
    named "sink". A sink implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSink) should
    install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
    ```c
    static void
    my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
    {
      GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
    
      // sinktemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
      // %GST_PAD_SINK and name "sink"
      gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &sinktemplate);
    
      gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
          "Sink name",
          "Sink",
          "My Sink element",
          "The author <my.sink@my.email>");
    }
    ```
    
    #GstBaseSink will handle the prerolling correctly. This means that it will
    return [gst.types.StateChangeReturn.Async] from a state change to PAUSED until the first
    buffer arrives in this element. The base class will call the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::preroll vmethod with this preroll buffer and will then
    commit the state change to the next asynchronously pending state.
    
    When the element is set to PLAYING, #GstBaseSink will synchronise on the
    clock using the times returned from #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times. If this
    function returns `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE` for the start time, no synchronisation
    will be done. Synchronisation can be disabled entirely by setting the object
    #GstBaseSink:sync property to false.
    
    After synchronisation the virtual method #GstBaseSinkClass::render will be
    called. Subclasses should minimally implement this method.
    
    Subclasses that synchronise on the clock in the #GstBaseSinkClass::render
    method are supported as well. These classes typically receive a buffer in
    the render method and can then potentially block on the clock while
    rendering. A typical example is an audiosink.
    These subclasses can use [gstbase.base_sink.BaseSink.waitPreroll] to perform the
    blocking wait.
    
    Upon receiving the EOS event in the PLAYING state, #GstBaseSink will wait
    for the clock to reach the time indicated by the stop time of the last
    #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times call before posting an EOS message. When the
    element receives EOS in PAUSED, preroll completes, the event is queued and an
    EOS message is posted when going to PLAYING.
    
    #GstBaseSink will internally use the [gst.types.EventType.Segment] events to schedule
    synchronisation and clipping of buffers. Buffers that fall completely outside
    of the current segment are dropped. Buffers that fall partially in the
    segment are rendered (and prerolled). Subclasses should do any subbuffer
    clipping themselves when needed.
    
    #GstBaseSink will by default report the current playback position in
    [gst.types.Format.Time] based on the current clock time and segment information.
    If no clock has been set on the element, the query will be forwarded
    upstream.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::set_caps function will be called when the subclass
    should configure itself to process a specific media type.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::start and #GstBaseSinkClass::stop virtual methods
    will be called when resources should be allocated. Any
    #GstBaseSinkClass::preroll, #GstBaseSinkClass::render and
    #GstBaseSinkClass::set_caps function will be called between the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::start and #GstBaseSinkClass::stop calls.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::event virtual method will be called when an event is
    received by #GstBaseSink. Normally this method should only be overridden by
    very specific elements (such as file sinks) which need to handle the
    newsegment event specially.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::unlock method is called when the elements should
    unblock any blocking operations they perform in the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::render method. This is mostly useful when the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::render method performs a blocking write on a file
    descriptor, for example.
    
    The #GstBaseSink:max-lateness property affects how the sink deals with
    buffers that arrive too late in the sink. A buffer arrives too late in the
    sink when the presentation time (as a combination of the last segment, buffer
    timestamp and element base_time) plus the duration is before the current
    time of the clock.
    If the frame is later than max-lateness, the sink will drop the buffer
    without calling the render method.
    This feature is disabled if sync is disabled, the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times method does not return a valid start time or
    max-lateness is set to -1 (the default).
    Subclasses can use [gstbase.base_sink.BaseSink.setMaxLateness] to configure the
    max-lateness value.
    
    The #GstBaseSink:qos property will enable the quality-of-service features of
    the basesink which gather statistics about the real-time performance of the
    clock synchronisation. For each buffer received in the sink, statistics are
    gathered and a QOS event is sent upstream with these numbers. This
    information can then be used by upstream elements to reduce their processing
    rate, for example.
    
    The #GstBaseSink:async property can be used to instruct the sink to never
    perform an ASYNC state change. This feature is mostly usable when dealing
    with non-synchronized streams or sparse streams.

    This is a generic base class for source elements. The following
    types of sources are supported:
    
      $(LIST
          * random access sources like files
          * seekable sources
          * live sources
      )
        
    The source can be configured to operate in any #GstFormat with the
    [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.setFormat] method. The currently set format determines
    the format of the internal #GstSegment and any [gst.types.EventType.Segment]
    events. The default format for #GstBaseSrc is [gst.types.Format.Bytes].
    
    #GstBaseSrc always supports push mode scheduling. If the following
    conditions are met, it also supports pull mode scheduling:
    
      $(LIST
          * The format is set to [gst.types.Format.Bytes] (default).
          * #GstBaseSrcClass::is_seekable returns true.
      )
        
    If all the conditions are met for operating in pull mode, #GstBaseSrc is
    automatically seekable in push mode as well. The following conditions must
    be met to make the element seekable in push mode when the format is not
    [gst.types.Format.Bytes]:
    
    $(LIST
      * #GstBaseSrcClass::is_seekable returns true.
      * #GstBaseSrcClass::query can convert all supported seek formats to the
        internal format as set with [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.setFormat].
      * #GstBaseSrcClass::do_seek is implemented, performs the seek and returns
         true.
    )
      
    When the element does not meet the requirements to operate in pull mode, the
    offset and length in the #GstBaseSrcClass::create method should be ignored.
    It is recommended to subclass #GstPushSrc instead, in this situation. If the
    element can operate in pull mode but only with specific offsets and
    lengths, it is allowed to generate an error when the wrong values are passed
    to the #GstBaseSrcClass::create function.
    
    #GstBaseSrc has support for live sources. Live sources are sources that when
    paused discard data, such as audio or video capture devices. A typical live
    source also produces data at a fixed rate and thus provides a clock to publish
    this rate.
    Use [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.setLive] to activate the live source mode.
    
    A live source does not produce data in the PAUSED state. This means that the
    #GstBaseSrcClass::create method will not be called in PAUSED but only in
    PLAYING. To signal the pipeline that the element will not produce data, the
    return value from the READY to PAUSED state will be
    [gst.types.StateChangeReturn.NoPreroll].
    
    A typical live source will timestamp the buffers it creates with the
    current running time of the pipeline. This is one reason why a live source
    can only produce data in the PLAYING state, when the clock is actually
    distributed and running.
    
    Live sources that synchronize and block on the clock (an audio source, for
    example) can use [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.waitPlaying] when the
    #GstBaseSrcClass::create function was interrupted by a state change to
    PAUSED.
    
    The #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times method can be used to implement pseudo-live
    sources. It only makes sense to implement the #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times
    function if the source is a live source. The #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times
    function should return timestamps starting from 0, as if it were a non-live
    source. The base class will make sure that the timestamps are transformed
    into the current running_time. The base source will then wait for the
    calculated running_time before pushing out the buffer.
    
    For live sources, the base class will by default report a latency of 0.
    For pseudo live sources, the base class will by default measure the difference
    between the first buffer timestamp and the start time of get_times and will
    report this value as the latency.
    Subclasses should override the query function when this behaviour is not
    acceptable.
    
    There is only support in #GstBaseSrc for exactly one source pad, which
    should be named "src". A source implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSrc)
    should install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
    ```c
    static void
    my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
    {
      GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
      // srctemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
      // %GST_PAD_SRC and name "src"
      gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &srctemplate);
    
      gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
         "Source name",
         "Source",
         "My Source element",
         "The author <my.sink@my.email>");
    }
    ```
    
    ## Controlled shutdown of live sources in applications
    
    Applications that record from a live source may want to stop recording
    in a controlled way, so that the recording is stopped, but the data
    already in the pipeline is processed to the end (remember that many live
    sources would go on recording forever otherwise). For that to happen the
    application needs to make the source stop recording and send an EOS
    event down the pipeline. The application would then wait for an
    EOS message posted on the pipeline's bus to know when all data has
    been processed and the pipeline can safely be stopped.
    
    An application may send an EOS event to a source element to make it
    perform the EOS logic (send EOS event downstream or post a
    [gst.types.MessageType.SegmentDone] on the bus). This can typically be done
    with the [gst.element.Element.sendEvent] function on the element or its parent bin.
    
    After the EOS has been sent to the element, the application should wait for
    an EOS message to be posted on the pipeline's bus. Once this EOS message is
    received, it may safely shut down the entire pipeline.

    Utility struct to help handling #GstFlowReturn combination. Useful for
    #GstElement<!-- -->s that have multiple source pads and need to combine
    the different #GstFlowReturn for those pads.
    
    #GstFlowCombiner works by using the last #GstFlowReturn for all #GstPad
    it has in its list and computes the combined return value and provides
    it to the caller.
    
    To add a new pad to the #GstFlowCombiner use [gstbase.flow_combiner.FlowCombiner.addPad].
    The new #GstPad is stored with a default value of [gst.types.FlowReturn.Ok].
    
    In case you want a #GstPad to be removed, use [gstbase.flow_combiner.FlowCombiner.removePad].
    
    Please be aware that this struct isn't thread safe as its designed to be
     used by demuxers, those usually will have a single thread operating it.
    
    These functions will take refs on the passed #GstPad<!-- -->s.
    
    Aside from reducing the user's code size, the main advantage of using this
    helper struct is to follow the standard rules for #GstFlowReturn combination.
    These rules are:
    
    $(LIST
      * [gst.types.FlowReturn.Eos]: only if all returns are EOS too
      * [gst.types.FlowReturn.NotLinked]: only if all returns are NOT_LINKED too
      * [gst.types.FlowReturn.Error] or below: if at least one returns an error return
      * [gst.types.FlowReturn.NotNegotiated]: if at least one returns a not-negotiated return
      * [gst.types.FlowReturn.Flushing]: if at least one returns flushing
      * [gst.types.FlowReturn.Ok]: otherwise
    )
      
    [gst.types.FlowReturn.Error] or below, GST_FLOW_NOT_NEGOTIATED and GST_FLOW_FLUSHING are
    returned immediately from the [gstbase.flow_combiner.FlowCombiner.updateFlow] function.
