/**
    This base class is for parser elements that process data and splits it
  into separate audio/video/whatever frames.
  
  It provides for:
  
    $(LIST
        * provides one sink pad and one source pad
        * handles state changes
        * can operate in pull mode or push mode
        * handles seeking in both modes
        * handles events (SEGMENT/EOS/FLUSH)
        * handles queries (POSITION/DURATION/SEEKING/FORMAT/CONVERT)
        * handles flushing
    )
      
  The purpose of this base class is to provide the basic functionality of
  a parser and share a lot of rather complex code.
  
  # Description of the parsing mechanism:
  
  ## Set-up phase
  
   $(LIST
      * #GstBaseParse calls #GstBaseParseClass::start to inform subclass
        that data processing is about to start now.
     
      * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass::set_sink_caps to
        inform the subclass about incoming sinkpad caps. Subclass could
        already set the srcpad caps accordingly, but this might be delayed
        until calling [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.finishFrame] with a non-queued frame.
     
      * At least at this point subclass needs to tell the #GstBaseParse class
        how big data chunks it wants to receive (minimum frame size ). It can
        do this with [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setMinFrameSize].
     
      * #GstBaseParse class sets up appropriate data passing mode (pull/push)
        and starts to process the data.
   )
     
  ## Parsing phase
  
   $(LIST
      * #GstBaseParse gathers at least min_frame_size bytes of data either
        by pulling it from upstream or collecting buffers in an internal
        #GstAdapter.
     
      * A buffer of (at least) min_frame_size bytes is passed to subclass
        with #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame. Subclass checks the contents
        and can optionally return #GST_FLOW_OK along with an amount of data
        to be skipped to find a valid frame (which will result in a
        subsequent DISCONT).  If, otherwise, the buffer does not hold a
        complete frame, #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame can merely return
        and will be called again when additional data is available.  In push
        mode this amounts to an additional input buffer (thus minimal
        additional latency), in pull mode this amounts to some arbitrary
        reasonable buffer size increase.
     
        Of course, [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setMinFrameSize] could also be used if
        a very specific known amount of additional data is required.  If,
        however, the buffer holds a complete valid frame, it can pass the
        size of this frame to [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.finishFrame].
     
        If acting as a converter, it can also merely indicate consumed input
        data while simultaneously providing custom output data.  Note that
        baseclass performs some processing (such as tracking overall consumed
        data rate versus duration) for each finished frame, but other state
        is only updated upon each call to #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame
        (such as tracking upstream input timestamp).
     
        Subclass is also responsible for setting the buffer metadata
        (e.g. buffer timestamp and duration, or keyframe if applicable).
        (although the latter can also be done by #GstBaseParse if it is
        appropriately configured, see below).  Frame is provided with
        timestamp derived from upstream (as much as generally possible),
        duration obtained from configuration (see below), and offset
        if meaningful (in pull mode).
     
        Note that #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame might receive any small
        amount of input data when leftover data is being drained (e.g. at
        EOS).
     
      * As part of finish frame processing, just prior to actually pushing
        the buffer in question, it is passed to
        #GstBaseParseClass::pre_push_frame which gives subclass yet one last
        chance to examine buffer metadata, or to send some custom (tag)
        events, or to perform custom (segment) filtering.
     
      * During the parsing process #GstBaseParseClass will handle both srcpad
        and sinkpad events. They will be passed to subclass if
        #GstBaseParseClass::sink_event or #GstBaseParseClass::src_event
        implementations have been provided.
   )
     
  ## Shutdown phase
  
  $(LIST
    * #GstBaseParse class calls #GstBaseParseClass::stop to inform the
      subclass that data parsing will be stopped.
  )
    
  Subclass is responsible for providing pad template caps for source and
  sink pads. The pads need to be named "sink" and "src". It also needs to
  set the fixed caps on srcpad, when the format is ensured (e.g.  when
  base class calls subclass' #GstBaseParseClass::set_sink_caps function).
  
  This base class uses [gst.types.Format.Default] as a meaning of frames. So,
  subclass conversion routine needs to know that conversion from
  [gst.types.Format.Time] to [gst.types.Format.Default] must return the
  frame number that can be found from the given byte position.
  
  #GstBaseParse uses subclasses conversion methods also for seeking (or
  otherwise uses its own default one, see also below).
  
  Subclass @start and @stop functions will be called to inform the beginning
  and end of data processing.
  
  Things that subclass need to take care of:
  
  $(LIST
    * Provide pad templates
    * Fixate the source pad caps when appropriate
    * Inform base class how big data chunks should be retrieved. This is
      done with [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setMinFrameSize] function.
    * Examine data chunks passed to subclass with
      #GstBaseParseClass::handle_frame and pass proper frame(s) to
      [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.finishFrame], and setting src pad caps and timestamps
      on frame.
    * Provide conversion functions
    * Update the duration information with [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setDuration]
    * Optionally passthrough using [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setPassthrough]
    * Configure various baseparse parameters using
      [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setAverageBitrate], [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setSyncable]
      and [gstbase.base_parse.BaseParse.setFrameRate].
    
    * In particular, if subclass is unable to determine a duration, but
      parsing (or specs) yields a frames per seconds rate, then this can be
      provided to #GstBaseParse to enable it to cater for buffer time
      metadata (which will be taken from upstream as much as
      possible). Internally keeping track of frame durations and respective
      sizes that have been pushed provides #GstBaseParse with an estimated
      bitrate. A default #GstBaseParseClass::convert (used if not
      overridden) will then use these rates to perform obvious conversions.
      These rates are also used to update (estimated) duration at regular
      frame intervals.
