/**
    #GstBaseSink is the base class for sink elements in GStreamer, such as
    xvimagesink or filesink. It is a layer on top of #GstElement that provides a
    simplified interface to plugin writers. #GstBaseSink handles many details
    for you, for example: preroll, clock synchronization, state changes,
    activation in push or pull mode, and queries.
    
    In most cases, when writing sink elements, there is no need to implement
    class methods from #GstElement or to set functions on pads, because the
    #GstBaseSink infrastructure should be sufficient.
    
    #GstBaseSink provides support for exactly one sink pad, which should be
    named "sink". A sink implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSink) should
    install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
    ```c
    static void
    my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
    {
      GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
    
      // sinktemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
      // %GST_PAD_SINK and name "sink"
      gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &sinktemplate);
    
      gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
          "Sink name",
          "Sink",
          "My Sink element",
          "The author <my.sink@my.email>");
    }
    ```
    
    #GstBaseSink will handle the prerolling correctly. This means that it will
    return [gst.types.StateChangeReturn.Async] from a state change to PAUSED until the first
    buffer arrives in this element. The base class will call the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::preroll vmethod with this preroll buffer and will then
    commit the state change to the next asynchronously pending state.
    
    When the element is set to PLAYING, #GstBaseSink will synchronise on the
    clock using the times returned from #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times. If this
    function returns `GST_CLOCK_TIME_NONE` for the start time, no synchronisation
    will be done. Synchronisation can be disabled entirely by setting the object
    #GstBaseSink:sync property to false.
    
    After synchronisation the virtual method #GstBaseSinkClass::render will be
    called. Subclasses should minimally implement this method.
    
    Subclasses that synchronise on the clock in the #GstBaseSinkClass::render
    method are supported as well. These classes typically receive a buffer in
    the render method and can then potentially block on the clock while
    rendering. A typical example is an audiosink.
    These subclasses can use [gstbase.base_sink.BaseSink.waitPreroll] to perform the
    blocking wait.
    
    Upon receiving the EOS event in the PLAYING state, #GstBaseSink will wait
    for the clock to reach the time indicated by the stop time of the last
    #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times call before posting an EOS message. When the
    element receives EOS in PAUSED, preroll completes, the event is queued and an
    EOS message is posted when going to PLAYING.
    
    #GstBaseSink will internally use the [gst.types.EventType.Segment] events to schedule
    synchronisation and clipping of buffers. Buffers that fall completely outside
    of the current segment are dropped. Buffers that fall partially in the
    segment are rendered (and prerolled). Subclasses should do any subbuffer
    clipping themselves when needed.
    
    #GstBaseSink will by default report the current playback position in
    [gst.types.Format.Time] based on the current clock time and segment information.
    If no clock has been set on the element, the query will be forwarded
    upstream.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::set_caps function will be called when the subclass
    should configure itself to process a specific media type.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::start and #GstBaseSinkClass::stop virtual methods
    will be called when resources should be allocated. Any
    #GstBaseSinkClass::preroll, #GstBaseSinkClass::render and
    #GstBaseSinkClass::set_caps function will be called between the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::start and #GstBaseSinkClass::stop calls.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::event virtual method will be called when an event is
    received by #GstBaseSink. Normally this method should only be overridden by
    very specific elements (such as file sinks) which need to handle the
    newsegment event specially.
    
    The #GstBaseSinkClass::unlock method is called when the elements should
    unblock any blocking operations they perform in the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::render method. This is mostly useful when the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::render method performs a blocking write on a file
    descriptor, for example.
    
    The #GstBaseSink:max-lateness property affects how the sink deals with
    buffers that arrive too late in the sink. A buffer arrives too late in the
    sink when the presentation time (as a combination of the last segment, buffer
    timestamp and element base_time) plus the duration is before the current
    time of the clock.
    If the frame is later than max-lateness, the sink will drop the buffer
    without calling the render method.
    This feature is disabled if sync is disabled, the
    #GstBaseSinkClass::get_times method does not return a valid start time or
    max-lateness is set to -1 (the default).
    Subclasses can use [gstbase.base_sink.BaseSink.setMaxLateness] to configure the
    max-lateness value.
    
    The #GstBaseSink:qos property will enable the quality-of-service features of
    the basesink which gather statistics about the real-time performance of the
    clock synchronisation. For each buffer received in the sink, statistics are
    gathered and a QOS event is sent upstream with these numbers. This
    information can then be used by upstream elements to reduce their processing
    rate, for example.
    
    The #GstBaseSink:async property can be used to instruct the sink to never
    perform an ASYNC state change. This feature is mostly usable when dealing
    with non-synchronized streams or sparse streams.
