/**
    This class is for elements that receive buffers in an undesired size.
    While for example raw video contains one image per buffer, the same is not
    true for a lot of other formats, especially those that come directly from
    a file. So if you have undefined buffer sizes and require a specific size,
    this object is for you.
    
    An adapter is created with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.new_]. It can be freed again with
    [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.unref].
    
    The theory of operation is like this: All buffers received are put
    into the adapter using [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.push] and the data is then read back
    in chunks of the desired size using [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.map]/[gstbase.adapter.Adapter.unmap]
    and/or [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.copy]. After the data has been processed, it is freed
    using [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.unmap].
    
    Other methods such as [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.take] and [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.takeBuffer]
    combine [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.map] and [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.unmap] in one method and are
    potentially more convenient for some use cases.
    
    For example, a sink pad's chain function that needs to pass data to a library
    in 512-byte chunks could be implemented like this:
    ```c
    static GstFlowReturn
    sink_pad_chain (GstPad *pad, GstObject *parent, GstBuffer *buffer)
    {
      MyElement *this;
      GstAdapter *adapter;
      GstFlowReturn ret = GST_FLOW_OK;
    
      this = MY_ELEMENT (parent);
    
      adapter = this->adapter;
    
      // put buffer into adapter
      gst_adapter_push (adapter, buffer);
    
      // while we can read out 512 bytes, process them
      while (gst_adapter_available (adapter) >= 512 && ret == GST_FLOW_OK) {
        const guint8 *data = gst_adapter_map (adapter, 512);
        // use flowreturn as an error value
        ret = my_library_foo (data);
        gst_adapter_unmap (adapter);
        gst_adapter_flush (adapter, 512);
      }
      return ret;
    }
    ```
    
    For another example, a simple element inside GStreamer that uses #GstAdapter
    is the libvisual element.
    
    An element using #GstAdapter in its sink pad chain function should ensure that
    when the FLUSH_STOP event is received, that any queued data is cleared using
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.clear]. Data should also be cleared or processed on EOS and
    when changing state from [gst.types.State.Paused] to [gst.types.State.Ready].
    
    Also check the GST_BUFFER_FLAG_DISCONT flag on the buffer. Some elements might
    need to clear the adapter after a discontinuity.
    
    The adapter will keep track of the timestamps of the buffers
    that were pushed. The last seen timestamp before the current position
    can be queried with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.prevPts]. This function can
    optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer that
    carried the timestamp and the current adapter position. The distance is
    useful when dealing with, for example, raw audio samples because it allows
    you to calculate the timestamp of the current adapter position by using the
    last seen timestamp and the amount of bytes since.  Additionally, the
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.prevPtsAtOffset] can be used to determine the last
    seen timestamp at a particular offset in the adapter.
    
    The adapter will also keep track of the offset of the buffers
    (#GST_BUFFER_OFFSET) that were pushed. The last seen offset before the
    current position can be queried with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.prevOffset]. This function
    can optionally return the number of bytes between the start of the buffer
    that carried the offset and the current adapter position.
    
    Additionally the adapter also keeps track of the PTS, DTS and buffer offset
    at the last discontinuity, which can be retrieved with
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.ptsAtDiscont], [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.dtsAtDiscont] and
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.offsetAtDiscont]. The number of bytes that were consumed
    since then can be queried with [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.distanceFromDiscont].
    
    A last thing to note is that while #GstAdapter is pretty optimized,
    merging buffers still might be an operation that requires a `malloc()` and
    `memcpy()` operation, and these operations are not the fastest. Because of
    this, some functions like [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.availableFast] are provided to help
    speed up such cases should you want to. To avoid repeated memory allocations,
    [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.copy] can be used to copy data into a (statically allocated)
    user provided buffer.
    
    #GstAdapter is not MT safe. All operations on an adapter must be serialized by
    the caller. This is not normally a problem, however, as the normal use case
    of #GstAdapter is inside one pad's chain function, in which case access is
    serialized via the pad's STREAM_LOCK.
    
    Note that [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.push] takes ownership of the buffer passed. Use
    gst_buffer_ref() before pushing it into the adapter if you still want to
    access the buffer later. The adapter will never modify the data in the
    buffer pushed in it.

  /**
      Returns a #GstBuffer containing the first nbytes of the adapter.
      The returned bytes will be flushed from the adapter.  This function
      is potentially more performant than [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.takeBuffer] since
      it can reuse the memory in pushed buffers by subbuffering or
      merging. Unlike [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.takeBuffer], the returned buffer may
      be composed of multiple non-contiguous #GstMemory objects, no
      copies are made.
      
      Note that no assumptions should be made as to whether certain buffer
      flags such as the DISCONT flag are set on the returned buffer, or not.
      The caller needs to explicitly set or unset flags that should be set or
      unset.
      
      This will also copy over all GstMeta of the input buffers except
      for meta with the [gst.types.MetaFlags.Pooled] flag or with the "memory" tag.
      
      This function can return buffer up to the return value of
      [gstbase.adapter.Adapter.available] without making copies if possible.
      
      Caller owns a reference to the returned buffer. gst_buffer_unref() after
      usage.
