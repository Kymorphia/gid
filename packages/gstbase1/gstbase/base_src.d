/**
    This is a generic base class for source elements. The following
    types of sources are supported:
    
      $(LIST
          * random access sources like files
          * seekable sources
          * live sources
      )
        
    The source can be configured to operate in any #GstFormat with the
    [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.setFormat] method. The currently set format determines
    the format of the internal #GstSegment and any [gst.types.EventType.Segment]
    events. The default format for #GstBaseSrc is [gst.types.Format.Bytes].
    
    #GstBaseSrc always supports push mode scheduling. If the following
    conditions are met, it also supports pull mode scheduling:
    
      $(LIST
          * The format is set to [gst.types.Format.Bytes] (default).
          * #GstBaseSrcClass::is_seekable returns true.
      )
        
    If all the conditions are met for operating in pull mode, #GstBaseSrc is
    automatically seekable in push mode as well. The following conditions must
    be met to make the element seekable in push mode when the format is not
    [gst.types.Format.Bytes]:
    
    $(LIST
      * #GstBaseSrcClass::is_seekable returns true.
      * #GstBaseSrcClass::query can convert all supported seek formats to the
        internal format as set with [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.setFormat].
      * #GstBaseSrcClass::do_seek is implemented, performs the seek and returns
         true.
    )
      
    When the element does not meet the requirements to operate in pull mode, the
    offset and length in the #GstBaseSrcClass::create method should be ignored.
    It is recommended to subclass #GstPushSrc instead, in this situation. If the
    element can operate in pull mode but only with specific offsets and
    lengths, it is allowed to generate an error when the wrong values are passed
    to the #GstBaseSrcClass::create function.
    
    #GstBaseSrc has support for live sources. Live sources are sources that when
    paused discard data, such as audio or video capture devices. A typical live
    source also produces data at a fixed rate and thus provides a clock to publish
    this rate.
    Use [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.setLive] to activate the live source mode.
    
    A live source does not produce data in the PAUSED state. This means that the
    #GstBaseSrcClass::create method will not be called in PAUSED but only in
    PLAYING. To signal the pipeline that the element will not produce data, the
    return value from the READY to PAUSED state will be
    [gst.types.StateChangeReturn.NoPreroll].
    
    A typical live source will timestamp the buffers it creates with the
    current running time of the pipeline. This is one reason why a live source
    can only produce data in the PLAYING state, when the clock is actually
    distributed and running.
    
    Live sources that synchronize and block on the clock (an audio source, for
    example) can use [gstbase.base_src.BaseSrc.waitPlaying] when the
    #GstBaseSrcClass::create function was interrupted by a state change to
    PAUSED.
    
    The #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times method can be used to implement pseudo-live
    sources. It only makes sense to implement the #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times
    function if the source is a live source. The #GstBaseSrcClass::get_times
    function should return timestamps starting from 0, as if it were a non-live
    source. The base class will make sure that the timestamps are transformed
    into the current running_time. The base source will then wait for the
    calculated running_time before pushing out the buffer.
    
    For live sources, the base class will by default report a latency of 0.
    For pseudo live sources, the base class will by default measure the difference
    between the first buffer timestamp and the start time of get_times and will
    report this value as the latency.
    Subclasses should override the query function when this behaviour is not
    acceptable.
    
    There is only support in #GstBaseSrc for exactly one source pad, which
    should be named "src". A source implementation (subclass of #GstBaseSrc)
    should install a pad template in its class_init function, like so:
    ```c
    static void
    my_element_class_init (GstMyElementClass *klass)
    {
      GstElementClass *gstelement_class = GST_ELEMENT_CLASS (klass);
      // srctemplate should be a #GstStaticPadTemplate with direction
      // %GST_PAD_SRC and name "src"
      gst_element_class_add_static_pad_template (gstelement_class, &srctemplate);
    
      gst_element_class_set_static_metadata (gstelement_class,
         "Source name",
         "Source",
         "My Source element",
         "The author <my.sink@my.email>");
    }
    ```
    
    ## Controlled shutdown of live sources in applications
    
    Applications that record from a live source may want to stop recording
    in a controlled way, so that the recording is stopped, but the data
    already in the pipeline is processed to the end (remember that many live
    sources would go on recording forever otherwise). For that to happen the
    application needs to make the source stop recording and send an EOS
    event down the pipeline. The application would then wait for an
    EOS message posted on the pipeline's bus to know when all data has
    been processed and the pipeline can safely be stopped.
    
    An application may send an EOS event to a source element to make it
    perform the EOS logic (send EOS event downstream or post a
    [gst.types.MessageType.SegmentDone] on the bus). This can typically be done
    with the [gst.element.Element.sendEvent] function on the element or its parent bin.
    
    After the EOS has been sent to the element, the application should wait for
    an EOS message to be posted on the pipeline's bus. Once this EOS message is
    received, it may safely shut down the entire pipeline.
