      alignment_threshold gives the tolerance in nanoseconds after which a

      discont_wait nanoseconds have to pass without going below the threshold
      again until the output buffer is marked as a discontinuity. These can later

      A discontinuity is detected once the difference between the actual
      timestamp and the timestamp calculated from the sample count since the last
      discontinuity differs by more than the alignment threshold for a duration
      longer than discont wait.
      
      Note: In reverse playback, every buffer is considered discontinuous in the
      context of buffer flags because the last sample of the previous buffer is
      discontinuous with the first sample of the current one. However for this
      function they are only considered discontinuous in reverse playback if the
      first sample of the previous buffer is discontinuous with the last sample
