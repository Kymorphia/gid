/**
    Subclasses must use (a subclass of) #GstAudioAggregatorPad for both
    their source and sink pads,
    [gst.element_class.ElementClass.addStaticPadTemplateWithGtype] is a convenient
    helper.
    
    #GstAudioAggregator can perform conversion on the data arriving
    on its sink pads, based on the format expected downstream: in order
    to enable that behaviour, the GType of the sink pads must either be
    a (subclass of) #GstAudioAggregatorConvertPad to use the default
    #GstAudioConverter implementation, or a subclass of #GstAudioAggregatorPad
    implementing #GstAudioAggregatorPadClass.convert_buffer.
    
    To allow for the output caps to change, the mechanism is the same as
    above, with the GType of the source pad.
    
    See #GstAudioMixer for an example.
    
    When conversion is enabled, #GstAudioAggregator will accept
    any type of raw audio caps and perform conversion
    on the data arriving on its sink pads, with whatever downstream
    expects as the target format.
    
    In case downstream caps are not fully fixated, it will use
    the first configured sink pad to finish fixating its source pad
    caps.
    
    A notable exception for now is the sample rate, sink pads must
    have the same sample rate as either the downstream requirement,
    or the first configured pad, or a combination of both (when
    downstream specifies a range or a set of acceptable rates).
    
    The #GstAggregator::samples-selected signal is provided with some
    additional information about the output buffer:
    $(LIST
      * "offset"  G_TYPE_UINT64   Offset in samples since segment start
        for the position that is next to be filled in the output buffer.
      * "frames"  G_TYPE_UINT   Number of frames per output buffer.
    )
      
    In addition the [gstbase.aggregator.Aggregator.peekNextSample] function returns
    additional information in the info #GstStructure of the returned sample:
    $(LIST
      * "output-offset"  G_TYPE_UINT64   Sample offset in output segment relative to
        the output segment's start where the current position of this input
        buffer would be placed
      * "position"  G_TYPE_UINT   current position in the input buffer in samples
      * "size"  G_TYPE_UINT   size of the input buffer in samples
    )
