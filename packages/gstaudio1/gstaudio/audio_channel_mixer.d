      Check if mix is in passthrough.
    
    Only N x N mix identity matrices are considered passthrough,

    with 0.0 and 1.0.
    
    As this is floating point comparisons, if the values have been
    generated, they should be rounded up or down by explicit
    assignment of 0.0 or 1.0 to values within a user-defined
    epsilon, this code doesn't make assumptions as to what may
