  /**
      Maps an audio gstbuffer so that it can be read or written and stores the
    result of the map operation in buffer.
    
    This is especially useful when the gstbuffer is in non-interleaved (planar)
    layout, in which case this function will use the information in the
    gstbuffer's attached #GstAudioMeta in order to map each channel in a
    separate "plane" in #GstAudioBuffer. If a #GstAudioMeta is not attached
    on the gstbuffer, then it must be in interleaved layout.
    
    If a #GstAudioMeta is attached, then the #GstAudioInfo on the meta is checked
    against info. Normally, they should be equal, but in case they are not,
    a g_critical will be printed and the #GstAudioInfo from the meta will be
    used.
    
    In non-interleaved buffers, it is possible to have each channel on a separate
    #GstMemory. In this case, each memory will be mapped separately to avoid
    copying their contents in a larger memory area. Do note though that it is
    not supported to have a single channel spanning over two or more different
    #GstMemory objects. Although the map operation will likely succeed in this
    case, it will be highly sub-optimal and it is recommended to merge all the
    memories in the buffer before calling this function.
    
    Note: The actual #GstBuffer is not ref'ed, but it is required to stay valid
    as long as it's mapped.
    Params:
      buffer =       pointer to a #GstAudioBuffer
      info =       the audio properties of the buffer
      gstbuffer =       the #GstBuffer to be mapped
