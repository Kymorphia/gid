/**
    A [gio.property_action.PropertyAction] is a way to get a [gio.action.Action] with a state value
  reflecting and controlling the value of a [gobject.object.ObjectG] property.
  
  The state of the action will correspond to the value of the property.
  Changing it will change the property (assuming the requested value
  matches the requirements as specified in the [gobject.param_spec.ParamSpec]).
  
  Only the most common types are presently supported.  Booleans are
  mapped to booleans, strings to strings, signed/unsigned integers to
  int32/uint32 and floats and doubles to doubles.
  
  If the property is an enum then the state will be string-typed and
  conversion will automatically be performed between the enum value and
  ‘nick’ string as per the [gobject.enum_value.EnumValue] table.
  
  Flags types are not currently supported.
  
  Properties of object types, boxed types and pointer types are not
  supported and probably never will be.
  
  Properties of [glib.variant.VariantG] types are not currently supported.
  
  If the property is boolean-valued then the action will have a `NULL`
  parameter type, and activating the action (with no parameter) will
  toggle the value of the property.
  
  In all other cases, the parameter type will correspond to the type of
  the property.
  
  The general idea here is to reduce the number of locations where a
  particular piece of state is kept (and therefore has to be synchronised
  between). [gio.property_action.PropertyAction] does not have a separate state that is kept
  in sync with the property value — its state is the property value.
  
  For example, it might be useful to create a [gio.action.Action] corresponding
  to the `visible-child-name` property of a [[gtk.stack.Stack]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Stack.html)
  so that the current page can be switched from a menu.  The active radio
  indication in the menu is then directly determined from the active page of
  the [gtk.stack.Stack].
  
  An anti-example would be binding the `active-id` property on a
  [[gtk.combo_box.ComboBox]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ComboBox.html). This is
  because the state of the combo box itself is probably uninteresting and is
  actually being used to control something else.
  
  Another anti-example would be to bind to the `visible-child-name`
  property of a [[gtk.stack.Stack]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Stack.html) if
  this value is actually stored in [gio.settings.Settings].  In that case, the
  real source of the value is* [gio.settings.Settings].  If you want
  a [gio.action.Action] to control a setting stored in [gio.settings.Settings],
  see [gio.settings.Settings.createAction] instead, and possibly combine its
  use with [gio.settings.Settings.bind].
