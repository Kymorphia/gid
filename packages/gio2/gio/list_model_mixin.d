/**
    [gio.list_model.ListModel] is an interface that represents a mutable list of
    [gobject.object.ObjectG]. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets
    in user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
    convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
    updates.
    
    Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
    mechanism (normally the [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify] signal).  Taken
    together with the `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal, this provides
    for a list that can change its membership, and in which the members can
    change their individual properties.
    
    A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
    points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
    signal strength.
    
    It is important to note that the [gio.list_model.ListModel] itself does not report
    changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
    membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
    then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
    interested in.
    
    All items in a [gio.list_model.ListModel] are of (or derived from) the same type.
    [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItemType] returns that type.  The type may be an
    interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
    
    The semantics are close to that of an array:
    [gio.list_model.ListModel.getNItems] returns the number of items in the list
    and [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItem] returns an item at a (0-based) position.
    In order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
    you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
    [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItem] until it returns `NULL`.
    
    An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
    return the same object for a given position until all references to
    it are gone.
    
    On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
    objects that are currently ‘user visible’, in order to facilitate the
    maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
    reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
    
    This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
    thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
    implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
    the thread-default main context (see
    [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) in effect at the time that the
    model was created.
    
    Over time, it has established itself as good practice for list model
    implementations to provide properties `item-type` and `n-items` to
    ease working with them. While it is not required, it is recommended
    that implementations provide these two properties. They should return
    the values of [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItemType] and
    [gio.list_model.ListModel.getNItems] respectively and be defined as such:
    
    ```c
    properties[PROP_ITEM_TYPE] =
      g_param_spec_gtype ("item-type", NULL, NULL, G_TYPE_OBJECT,
                          G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY | G_PARAM_READWRITE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
    properties[PROP_N_ITEMS] =
      g_param_spec_uint ("n-items", NULL, NULL, 0, G_MAXUINT, 0,
                         G_PARAM_READABLE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
    ```

  /**
      Emits the #GListModel::items-changed signal on list.
      
      This function should only be called by classes implementing
      #GListModel. It has to be called after the internal representation
      of list has been updated, because handlers connected to this signal
      might query the new state of the list.
      
      Implementations must only make changes to the model (as visible to
      its consumer) in places that will not cause problems for that
      consumer.  For models that are driven directly by a write API (such
      as #GListStore), changes can be reported in response to uses of that
      API.  For models that represent remote data, changes should only be
      made from a fresh mainloop dispatch.  It is particularly not
      permitted to make changes in response to a call to the #GListModel
      consumer API.
      
      Stated another way: in general, it is assumed that code making a
      series of accesses to the model via the API, without returning to the
      mainloop, and without calling other code, will continue to view the
      same contents of the model.
