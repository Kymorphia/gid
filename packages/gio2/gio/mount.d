/**
    The [gio.mount.Mount] interface represents user-visible mounts. Note, when
    [porting from GnomeVFS](migrating-gnome-vfs.html), [gio.mount.Mount] is the moral
    equivalent of `GnomeVFSVolume`.
    
    [gio.mount.Mount] is a ‘mounted’ filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in
    quotes because it’s not the same as a UNIX mount, it might be a GVFS
    mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use GIO. Might or
    might not be related to a volume object.
    
    Unmounting a [gio.mount.Mount] instance is an asynchronous operation. For
    more information about asynchronous operations, see [gio.async_result.AsyncResult]
    and [gio.task.Task]. To unmount a [gio.mount.Mount] instance, first call
    [gio.mount.Mount.unmountWithOperation] with (at least) the [gio.mount.Mount]
    instance and a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback].  The callback will be fired
    when the operation has resolved (either with success or failure), and a
    [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] structure will be passed to the callback.  That
    callback should then call [gio.mount.Mount.unmountWithOperationFinish]
    with the [gio.mount.Mount] and the [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] data to see if the
    operation was completed successfully.  If an `error` is present when
    [gio.mount.Mount.unmountWithOperationFinish] is called, then it will be
    filled with any error information.

  /**
      Determines if mount is shadowed. Applications or libraries should
      avoid displaying mount in the user interface if it is shadowed.
      
      A mount is said to be shadowed if there exists one or more user
      visible objects (currently #GMount objects) with a root that is
      inside the root of mount.
      
      One application of shadow mounts is when exposing a single file
      system that is used to address several logical volumes. In this
      situation, a #GVolumeMonitor implementation would create two
      #GVolume objects (for example, one for the camera functionality of
      the device and one for a SD card reader on the device) with
      activation URIs `gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/store1/`
      and `gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/store2/`. When the
      underlying mount (with root
      `gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/`) is mounted, said
      #GVolumeMonitor implementation would create two #GMount objects
      (each with their root matching the corresponding volume activation
      root) that would shadow the original mount.
      
      The proxy monitor in GVfs 2.26 and later, automatically creates and
      manage shadow mounts (and shadows the underlying mount) if the
      activation root on a #GVolume is set.
      Returns: true if mount is shadowed.
