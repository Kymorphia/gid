/**
    [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream] is implemented by [gio.input_stream.InputStream]s that
    can be polled for readiness to read. This can be used when
    interfacing with a non-GIO API that expects
    UNIX-file-descriptor-style asynchronous I/O rather than GIO-style.
    
    Some classes may implement [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream] but have only certain
    instances of that class be pollable. If [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream.canPoll]
    returns false, then the behavior of other [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream] methods is
    undefined.

      For any given stream, the value returned by this method is constant;
      a stream cannot switch from pollable to non-pollable or vice versa.

      after this returns true would still block. To guarantee
      non-blocking behavior, you should always use

      Note that since this method never blocks, you cannot actually
      use cancellable to cancel it. However, it will return an error
      if cancellable has already been cancelled when you call, which
      may happen if you call this method after a source triggers due
      to having been cancelled.
