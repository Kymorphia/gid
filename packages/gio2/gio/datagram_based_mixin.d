/**
    Interface for socket-like objects with datagram semantics.
    
    A [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
    communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
    BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
    [gio.socket.Socket], which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
    
    [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
    alongside higher-level networking APIs such as [gio.iostream.IOStream].
    
    It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
    to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
    the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
    or system calls. For example, [gio.socket.Socket] uses `recvmmsg()` and `sendmmsg()`
    where possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
    multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
    assemble or disassemble a message.
    
    Each [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
    for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
    timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
    error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
    will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
    timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.TimedOut] if no progress was made. To know when a call would
    successfully run you can call [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] or
    [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionWait]. You can also use
    [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.createSource] and attach it to a [glib.main_context.MainContext]
    to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
    
    When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
    handle getting a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error even when some other function
    said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
    condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
    instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
    returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
    
    As with [gio.socket.Socket], [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased]s can be either connection oriented (for
    example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased]s must be
    datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
    establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
    before sending and receiving data through the [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] API. For
    connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
    received in each I/O operation.
    
    Like most other APIs in GLib, [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is not inherently thread safe.
    To use a [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] concurrently from multiple threads, you must
    implement your own locking.

  /**
      Checks on the readiness of datagram_based to perform operations. The
      operations specified in condition are checked for and masked against the
      currently-satisfied conditions on datagram_based. The result is returned.
      
      [glib.types.IOCondition.In] will be set in the return value if data is available to read with
      [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.receiveMessages], or if the connection is closed remotely
      (EOS); and if the datagram_based has not been closed locally using some
      implementation-specific method (such as [gio.socket.Socket.close] or
      [gio.socket.Socket.shutdown] with shutdown_read set, if it’s a #GSocket).
      
      If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling [gio.socket.Socket.close] or
      [gio.socket.Socket.shutdown] with shutdown_read set, if it’s a #GSocket, for
      example), all calls to this function will return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed].
      
      [glib.types.IOCondition.Out] will be set if it is expected that at least one byte can be sent
      using [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.sendMessages] without blocking. It will not be set
      if the datagram_based has been closed locally.
      
      [glib.types.IOCondition.Hup] will be set if the connection has been closed locally.
      
      [glib.types.IOCondition.Err] will be set if there was an asynchronous error in transmitting data
      previously enqueued using [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.sendMessages].
      
      Note that on Windows, it is possible for an operation to return
      [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] even immediately after
      [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] has claimed that the #GDatagramBased is
      ready for writing. Rather than calling [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] and
      then writing to the #GDatagramBased if it succeeds, it is generally better to
      simply try writing right away, and try again later if the initial attempt
      returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
      
      It is meaningless to specify [glib.types.IOCondition.Err] or [glib.types.IOCondition.Hup] in condition; these
      conditions will always be set in the output if they are true. Apart from
      these flags, the output is guaranteed to be masked by condition.
      
      This call never blocks.
