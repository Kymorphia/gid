/**
    The [gio.volume.Volume] interface represents user-visible objects that can be
    mounted. Note, when [porting from GnomeVFS](migrating-gnome-vfs.html),
    [gio.volume.Volume] is the moral equivalent of `GnomeVFSDrive`.
    
    Mounting a [gio.volume.Volume] instance is an asynchronous operation. For more
    information about asynchronous operations, see [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] and
    [gio.task.Task]. To mount a [gio.volume.Volume], first call [gio.volume.Volume.mount]
    with (at least) the [gio.volume.Volume] instance, optionally a
    [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] object and a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback].
    
    Typically, one will only want to pass `NULL` for the
    [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] if automounting all volumes when a desktop session
    starts since it’s not desirable to put up a lot of dialogs asking
    for credentials.
    
    The callback will be fired when the operation has resolved (either
    with success or failure), and a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] instance will be
    passed to the callback.  That callback should then call
    [gio.volume.Volume.mountFinish] with the [gio.volume.Volume] instance and the
    [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] data to see if the operation was completed
    successfully.  If a [glib.error.ErrorWrap] is present when
    [gio.volume.Volume.mountFinish] is called, then it will be filled with any
    error information.
    
    ## Volume Identifiers
    
    It is sometimes necessary to directly access the underlying
    operating system object behind a volume (e.g. for passing a volume
    to an application via the command line). For this purpose, GIO
    allows to obtain an ‘identifier’ for the volume. There can be
    different kinds of identifiers, such as Hal UDIs, filesystem labels,
    traditional Unix devices (e.g. `/dev/sda2`), UUIDs. GIO uses predefined
    strings as names for the different kinds of identifiers:
    `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UUID`, `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_LABEL`, etc.
    Use [gio.volume.Volume.getIdentifier] to obtain an identifier for a volume.
    
    Note that `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_HAL_UDI` will only be available
    when the GVFS hal volume monitor is in use. Other volume monitors
    will generally be able to provide the `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UNIX_DEVICE`
    identifier, which can be used to obtain a hal device by means of
    `libhal_manager_find_device_string_match()`.
