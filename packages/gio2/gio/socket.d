/**
    A [gio.socket.Socket] is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
    direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
    It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
    
    [gio.socket.Socket] is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
    network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
    use it directly, but rather through classes like [gio.socket_client.SocketClient],
    [gio.socket_service.SocketService] and [gio.socket_connection.SocketConnection]. However there may
    be cases where direct use of [gio.socket.Socket] is useful.
    
    [gio.socket.Socket] implements the [gio.initable.Initable] interface, so if it is manually
    constructed by e.g. [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.new_] you must call
    [gio.initable.Initable.init_] and check the results before using the object.
    This is done automatically in [gio.socket.Socket.new_] and
    [gio.socket.Socket.newFromFd], so these functions can return `NULL`.
    
    Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
    in blocking mode all operations (which don’t take an explicit blocking
    parameter) block until the requested operation
    is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
    would block return immediately with a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error.
    To know when a call would successfully run you can call
    [gio.socket.Socket.conditionCheck], or [gio.socket.Socket.conditionWait].
    You can also use [gio.socket.Socket.createSource] and attach it to a
    [glib.main_context.MainContext] to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
    Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
    blocking mode is emulated in [gio.socket.Socket].
    
    When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
    handle getting a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error even when some other
    function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
    of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
    reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
    until a write returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
    
    [gio.socket.Socket]s can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
    For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
    either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
    address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
    specified or received in each I/O operation.
    
    All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
    
    Note that creating a [gio.socket.Socket] causes the signal `SIGPIPE` to be
    ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
    command-line utility that uses [gio.socket.Socket], you may need to take into
    account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
    if it tries to write to `stdout` after it has been closed.
    
    Like most other APIs in GLib, [gio.socket.Socket] is not inherently thread safe. To use
    a [gio.socket.Socket] concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
    locking.
    
    ## Nagle’s algorithm
    
    Since GLib 2.80, [gio.socket.Socket] will automatically set the `TCP_NODELAY` option on
    all [gio.types.SocketType.Stream] sockets. This disables
    [Nagle’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle`27s_algorithm`) as it
    typically does more harm than good on modern networks.
    
    If your application needs Nagle’s algorithm enabled, call
    [gio.socket.Socket.setOption] after constructing a [gio.socket.Socket] to enable it:
    ```c
    socket = g_socket_new (…, G_SOCKET_TYPE_STREAM, …);
    if (socket != NULL)
      {
        g_socket_set_option (socket, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, FALSE, &local_error);
        // handle error if needed
      }
    ```

  /**
      When a socket is created it is attached to an address family, but it
      doesn't have an address in this family. [gio.socket.Socket.bind] assigns the
      address (sometimes called name) of the socket.
      
      It is generally required to bind to a local address before you can
      receive connections. (See [gio.socket.Socket.listen] and [gio.socket.Socket.accept] ).
      In certain situations, you may also want to bind a socket that will be
      used to initiate connections, though this is not normally required.
      
      If socket is a TCP socket, then allow_reuse controls the setting
      of the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option; normally it should be true for
      server sockets (sockets that you will eventually call
      [gio.socket.Socket.accept] on), and false for client sockets. (Failing to
      set this flag on a server socket may cause [gio.socket.Socket.bind] to return
      [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.AddressInUse] if the server program is stopped and then
      immediately restarted.)
      
      If socket is a UDP socket, then allow_reuse determines whether or
      not other UDP sockets can be bound to the same address at the same
      time. In particular, you can have several UDP sockets bound to the
      same address, and they will all receive all of the multicast and
      broadcast packets sent to that address. (The behavior of unicast
      UDP packets to an address with multiple listeners is not defined.)

      Closes the socket, shutting down any active connection.
      
      Closing a socket does not wait for all outstanding I/O operations
      to finish, so the caller should not rely on them to be guaranteed
      to complete even if the close returns with no error.
      
      Once the socket is closed, all other operations will return
      [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed]. Closing a socket multiple times will not
      return an error.
      
      Sockets will be automatically closed when the last reference
      is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
      resources are released as early as possible.
      
      Beware that due to the way that TCP works, it is possible for
      recently-sent data to be lost if either you close a socket while the
      [glib.types.IOCondition.In] condition is set, or else if the remote connection tries to
      send something to you after you close the socket but before it has
      finished reading all of the data you sent. There is no easy generic
      way to avoid this problem; the easiest fix is to design the network
      protocol such that the client will never send data "out of turn".
      Another solution is for the server to half-close the connection by
      calling [gio.socket.Socket.shutdown] with only the shutdown_write flag set,
      and then wait for the client to notice this and close its side of the
      connection, after which the server can safely call [gio.socket.Socket.close].

      [gio.tcp_connection.TcpConnection.setGracefulDisconnect]. But of course, this
      only works if the client will close its connection after the server
      does.)

      Receive data from a socket.  For receiving multiple messages, see
      [gio.socket.Socket.receiveMessages]; for easier use, see
      [gio.socket.Socket.receive] and [gio.socket.Socket.receiveFrom].
      
      If address is non-null then address will be set equal to the
      source address of the received packet.
      address is owned by the caller.
      
      vector must point to an array of #GInputVector structs and
      num_vectors must be the length of this array.  These structs
      describe the buffers that received data will be scattered into.
      If num_vectors is -1, then vectors is assumed to be terminated
      by a #GInputVector with a null buffer pointer.
      
      As a special case, if num_vectors is 0 (in which case, vectors
      may of course be null), then a single byte is received and
      discarded. This is to facilitate the common practice of sending a
      single '\0' byte for the purposes of transferring ancillary data.
      
      messages, if non-null, will be set to point to a newly-allocated
      array of #GSocketControlMessage instances or null if no such
      messages was received. These correspond to the control messages
      received from the kernel, one #GSocketControlMessage per message
      from the kernel. This array is null-terminated and must be freed
      by the caller using [glib.global.gfree] after calling [gobject.object.ObjectWrap.unref] on each
      element. If messages is null, any control messages received will
      be discarded.
      
      num_messages, if non-null, will be set to the number of control
      messages received.
      
      If both messages and num_messages are non-null, then
      num_messages gives the number of #GSocketControlMessage instances
      in messages (ie: not including the null terminator).
      
      flags is an in/out parameter. The commonly available arguments
      for this are available in the #GSocketMsgFlags enum, but the
      values there are the same as the system values, and the flags
      are passed in as-is, so you can pass in system-specific flags too
      (and [gio.socket.Socket.receiveMessage] may pass system-specific flags out).
      Flags passed in to the parameter affect the receive operation; flags returned
      out of it are relevant to the specific returned message.
      
      As with [gio.socket.Socket.receive], data may be discarded if socket is
      [gio.types.SocketType.Datagram] or [gio.types.SocketType.Seqpacket] and you do not
      provide enough buffer space to read a complete message. You can pass
      [gio.types.SocketMsgFlags.Peek] in flags to peek at the current message without
      removing it from the receive queue, but there is no portable way to find
      out the length of the message other than by reading it into a
      sufficiently-large buffer.
      
      If the socket is in blocking mode the call will block until there
      is some data to receive, the connection is closed, or there is an
      error. If there is no data available and the socket is in
      non-blocking mode, a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error will be
      returned. To be notified when data is available, wait for the
      [glib.types.IOCondition.In] condition.
      
      On error -1 is returned and error is set accordingly.

      also fail with [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.TimedOut] after the given time. Sources
      created with [gio.socket.Socket.createSource] will trigger after
      timeout seconds of inactivity, with the requested condition
      set, at which point calling [gio.socket.Socket.receive], [gio.socket.Socket.send],
      [gio.socket.Socket.checkConnectResult], etc, will fail with
      [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.TimedOut].
      
      If timeout is 0 (the default), operations will never time out
      on their own.
      
      Note that if an I/O operation is interrupted by a signal, this may
      cause the timeout to be reset.
