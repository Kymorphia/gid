/**
    Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
    really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
    [[gtk.builder.Builder]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Builder.html) `.ui` files,
    splashscreen images, [gio.menu.Menu] markup XML, CSS files, icons, etc.
    These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or manually
    included as literal strings in the code.
    
    The [gio.resource.Resource] API and the
    [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) program provide a
    convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties.
    You maintain the files as normal files, so it’s easy to edit them, but during
    the build the files are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the
    executable. This means that loading the resource files are efficient (as they
    are already in memory, shared with other instances) and simple (no need to
    check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
    also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
    
    Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included
    in the resource bundle in a compressed form, but will be automatically
    uncompressed when the resource is used. This is very useful e.g. for larger
    text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
    
    Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
    `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
    The only options currently supported are:
    
     $(LIST
        * `xml-stripblanks` which will use the [`xmllint`](man:xmllint(1)) command
          to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
          the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
          the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
          the preprocessing step is skipped.
       
        * `to-pixdata` (deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32) which will use the
          `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` command to convert images to the [`GdkPixdata`](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/class.Pixdata.html)
          format, which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside
          the resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the
          `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` program must be in the `PATH`, or the
          `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be set to the full path to
          the `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` executable; otherwise the resource compiler will
          abort. `to-pixdata` has been deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32, as
          [gio.resource.Resource] supports embedding modern image formats just as well. Instead
          of using it, embed a PNG or SVG file in your [gio.resource.Resource].
       
        * `json-stripblanks` which will use the
          [`json-glib-format`](man:json-glib-format(1)) command to strip ignorable
          whitespace from the JSON file. For this to work, the `JSON_GLIB_FORMAT`
          environment variable must be set to the full path to the
          `json-glib-format` executable, or it must be in the `PATH`; otherwise the
          preprocessing step is skipped. In addition, at least version 1.6 of
          `json-glib-format` is required.
     )
       
    Resource files will be exported in the [gio.resource.Resource] namespace using the
    combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
    The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
    different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
    include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
    directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
    
    Resource bundles are created by the
    [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) program
    which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that
    the XML references. These are combined into a binary resource bundle.
    
    An example resource description:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <gresources>
      <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
        <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
        <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
        <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
        <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
      </gresource>
    </gresources>
    ```
    
    This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
    ```
    /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
    /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
    /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
    /org/gtk/Example/example.css
    ```
    
    Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use
    Java-style path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
    
    You can then use [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) to
    compile the XML to a binary bundle that you can load with
    [gio.resource.Resource.load]. However, it’s more common to use the
    `--generate-source` and `--generate-header` arguments to create a source file
    and header to link directly into your application.
    This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
    `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
    to [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html). `get_resource()`
    returns the generated [gio.resource.Resource] object. The register and unregister
    functions register the resource so its files can be accessed using
    `func@Gio.resources_lookup_data`.
    
    Once a [gio.resource.Resource] has been created and registered all the data in it can be
    accessed globally in the process by using API calls like
    `func@Gio.resources_open_stream` to stream the data or
    `func@Gio.resources_lookup_data` to get a direct pointer to the data. You can
    also use URIs like `resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png` with
    [gio.file.File] to access the resource data.
    
    Some higher-level APIs, such as [[gtk.application.Application]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html),
    will automatically load resources from certain well-known paths in the
    resource namespace as a convenience. See the documentation for those APIs
    for details.
    
    There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the
    compiler support for constructor and destructor functions (where available)
    to automatically create and register the [gio.resource.Resource] on startup or library
    load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to
    register/unregister the resource are created instead. This requires an
    explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all
    platforms, even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported.
    (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
    
    Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a
    library, so if you are unloading libraries during runtime you need to be very
    careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes
    away when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally
    a problem, since most resource accesses are for your own resources, and
    resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
    
    # Overlays
    
    When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is
    often useful to be able to replace resources in the program or library,
    without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing purposes.
    Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment
    variable to selectively overlay resources with replacements from the
    filesystem.  It is a `G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR`-separated list of substitutions
    to perform during resource lookups. It is ignored when running in a setuid
    process.
    
    A substitution has the form
    
    ```
    /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
    ```
    
    The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay
    applies.  The part after is a filesystem path which contains files and
    subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
    equivalent names.
    
    In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the
    resource path `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then [gio.resource.Resource] would check
    the filesystem path `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was
    found there, it would be used instead.  This is an overlay, not an outright
    replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the
    built-in version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently
    supported.
    
    Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash
    before the `=`.  The path after the slash should ideally be absolute, but
    this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the location of a
    single resource with an individual file.
