  The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
  [gio.action.Action.activate]. This results in the 'activate' signal being
  emitted. An activation has a [glib.variant.VariantG] parameter (which may be
  `NULL`). The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
  parameter type (which is given at construction time).
  
  An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
  set with [gio.action.Action.changeState]. This call takes a #GVariant. The
  correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
  (which is given at construction time).
  
  The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
  range.
  
  [gio.action.Action] is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as
  described above.  Various implementations of actions exist, including
  [gio.simple_action.SimpleAction].
  
  In all cases, the implementing class is responsible for storing the
  name of the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the optional
  state type and the state and emitting the appropriate signals when these
  change. The implementor is responsible for filtering calls to
  [gio.action.Action.activate] and [gio.action.Action.changeState]
  for type safety and for the state being enabled.
  
  Probably the only useful thing to do with a [gio.action.Action] is to put it
  inside of a [gio.simple_action_group.SimpleActionGroup].

/**
    [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] represents a group of actions.
  
  Actions can be used to expose functionality in a structured way, either
  from one part of a program to another, or to the outside world. Action
  groups are often used together with a [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] that provides additional
  representation data for displaying the actions to the user, e.g. in a menu.
  
  The main way to interact with the actions in a [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] is to
  activate them with [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.activateAction]. Activating an
  action may require a [glib.variant.VariantG] parameter. The required type of the
  parameter can be inquired with [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionParameterType].
  Actions may be disabled, see [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionEnabled].
  Activating a disabled action has no effect.
  
  Actions may optionally have a state in the form of a #GVariant. The current
  state of an action can be inquired with [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionState].
  Activating a stateful action may change its state, but it is also possible to
  set the state by calling [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.changeActionState].
  
  As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an
  option to change the current font to 'bold'. A good way to represent
  this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
  action would toggle the state.
  
  Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
  method calls, except [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.listActions] take the name of
  an action as an argument.
  
  The [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
  group. The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
  forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
  with actions. 'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
  the action group implementation) are found on subclasses. This is
  why you will find - for example - [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionEnabled]
  but not an equivalent set() call.
  
  Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
  on individual actions.
  
  Implementations of [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] should provide implementations for
  the virtual functions [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.listActions] and
  [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.queryAction]. The other virtual functions should
  not be implemented - their "wrappers" are actually implemented with
  calls to [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.queryAction].

/**
    Information about an installed application and methods to launch
  it (with file arguments).
  
  [gio.app_info.AppInfo] and [gio.app_launch_context.AppLaunchContext] are used for describing and launching
  applications installed on the system.
  
  As of GLib 2.20, URIs will always be converted to POSIX paths
  (using [gio.file.File.getPath]) when using [gio.app_info.AppInfo.launch]
  even if the application requested an URI and not a POSIX path. For example
  for a desktop-file based application with Exec key `totem
  `U`` and a single URI, `sftp://foo/file.avi`, then
  `/home/user/.gvfs/sftp on foo/file.avi` will be passed. This will
  only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as GVfs 2.26
  compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
  is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.
  Some URIs, such as `mailto:`, of course cannot be mapped to a POSIX
  path (in GVfs there's no FUSE mount for it); such URIs will be
  passed unmodified to the application.
  
  Specifically for GVfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped
  back to the GIO URI in the [gio.file.File] constructors (since GVfs
  implements the GVfs extension point). As such, if the application
  needs to examine the URI, it needs to use [gio.file.File.getUri]
  or similar on [gio.file.File]. In other words, an application cannot
  assume that the URI passed to e.g. [gio.file.File.newForCommandlineArg]
  is equal to the result of [gio.file.File.getUri]. The following snippet
  illustrates this:
  
  ```c
  GFile *f;
  char *uri;
  
  file = g_file_new_for_commandline_arg (uri_from_commandline);
  
  uri = g_file_get_uri (file);
  strcmp (uri, uri_from_commandline) == 0;
  g_free (uri);
  
  if (g_file_has_uri_scheme (file, "cdda"))
    {
      // do something special with uri
    }
  g_object_unref (file);
  ```
  
  This code will work when both `cdda://sr0/Track 1.wav` and
  `/home/user/.gvfs/cdda on sr0/Track 1.wav` is passed to the
  application. It should be noted that it's generally not safe
  for applications to rely on the format of a particular URIs.
  Different launcher applications (e.g. file managers) may have
  different ideas of what a given URI means.

  [gio.app_info_monitor.AppInfoMonitor] is a very simple object used for monitoring the app
  info database for changes (newly installed or removed applications).
  
  Call [gio.app_info_monitor.AppInfoMonitor.get] to get a [gio.app_info_monitor.AppInfoMonitor] and connect
  to the [gio.app_info_monitor.AppInfoMonitor.changed] signal. The signal will be emitted once when
  the app info database changes, and will not be emitted again until after the
  next call to [gio.app_info.AppInfo.getAll] or another `g_app_info_*()` function.
  This is because monitoring the app info database for changes is expensive.
  
  The following functions will re-arm the [gio.app_info_monitor.AppInfoMonitor.changed]
  signal so it can be emitted again:
  
   $(LIST
      * [gio.app_info.AppInfo.getAll]
      * [gio.app_info.AppInfo.getAllForType]
      * [gio.app_info.AppInfo.getDefaultForType]
      * [gio.app_info.AppInfo.getFallbackForType]
      * [gio.app_info.AppInfo.getRecommendedForType]
      * [`[gio.desktop_app_info.DesktopAppInfo.getImplementations]`](../gio-unix/type_func.DesktopAppInfo.get_implementation.html)
      * [`[gio.desktop_app_info.DesktopAppInfo.new_]`](../gio-unix/ctor.DesktopAppInfo.new.html)

      * [`[gio.desktop_app_info.DesktopAppInfo.newFromKeyfile]`](../gio-unix/ctor.DesktopAppInfo.new_from_keyfile.html)
      * [`[gio.desktop_app_info.DesktopAppInfo.search]`](../gio-unix/type_func.DesktopAppInfo.search.html)
   )
     
  The latter functions are available if using
  [[gio.desktop_app_info.DesktopAppInfo]](../gio-unix/class.DesktopAppInfo.html) from
  `gio-unix-2.0.pc` (GIR namespace `GioUnix-2.0`).
  
  In the usual case, applications should try to make note of the change
  (doing things like invalidating caches) but not act on it. In
  particular, applications should avoid making calls to [gio.app_info.AppInfo] APIs
  in response to the change signal, deferring these until the time that
  the updated data is actually required. The exception to this case is when
  application information is actually being displayed on the screen
  (for example, during a search or when the list of all applications is shown).
  The reason for this is that changes to the list of installed applications
  often come in groups (like during system updates) and rescanning the list
  on every change is pointless and expensive.

/**
    [gio.application.Application] is the core class for application support.
  
  A [gio.application.Application] is the foundation of an application. It wraps some
  low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
  foundation for higher-level application classes such as
  [gtk.application.Application] or `MxApplication`. In general, you should not use
  this class outside of a higher level framework.
  
  [gio.application.Application] provides convenient life-cycle management by maintaining
  a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
  be changed using [gio.application.Application.hold] and
  [gio.application.Application.release]. If it drops to zero, the application
  exits. Higher-level classes such as [gtk.application.Application] employ the use count
  to ensure that the application stays alive as long as it has any opened
  windows.
  
  Another feature that [gio.application.Application] (optionally) provides is process
  uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
  providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
  with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
  concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
  desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
  arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
  running program. The already running instance of the program is
  called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
  always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
  is used for communication.
  
  The use of [gio.application.Application] differs from some other commonly-used
  uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
  application is not expected to manually register itself and check
  if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
  [gio.application.Application] should do very little more than instantiating the
  application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
  calling [gio.application.Application.run]. All checks for uniqueness are done
  internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
  startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
  is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
  instance and [gio.application.Application.run] promptly returns. See the code
  examples below.
  
  If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the
  same as that of a
  [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
  Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
  `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
  For details on valid application identifiers, see [gio.application.Application.idIsValid].
  
  On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
  on the user's session bus. This means that the uniqueness of your
  application is scoped to the current session. It also means that your
  application may provide additional services (through registration of other
  object paths) at that bus name. The registration of these object paths
  should be done with the shared GDBus session bus. Note that due to the
  internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
  (even if a main loop is not running). For this reason, you must ensure that
  any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
  attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
  [gio.application.Application.register]). Unfortunately, this means that you cannot
  use `property@Gio.Application:is-remote` to decide if you want to register
  object paths.
  
  [gio.application.Application] also implements the [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] and [gio.action_map.ActionMap]
  interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
  [gio.action_map.ActionMap.addAction]. When invoking an action by calling
  [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.activateAction] on the application, it is always
  invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
  the session bus, and GIO provides the [gio.dbus_action_group.DBusActionGroup] wrapper to
  conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a [gio.dbus_menu_model.DBusMenuModel] wrapper
  for remote access to exported [gio.menu_model.MenuModel]s.
  
  Note: Due to the fact that actions are exported on the session bus,
  using `maybe` parameters is not supported, since D-Bus does not support
  `maybe` types.
  
  There is a number of different entry points into a [gio.application.Application]:
  
  $(LIST
    * via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
    
    * via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
    
    * by handling a command-line
    
    * via activating an action
  )
    
  The [gio.application.Application.startup] signal lets you handle the application
  initialization for all of these in a single place.
  
  Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
  application, [gio.application.Application] passes some ‘platform data’ from the
  launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
  [glib.variant.VariantG] dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
  data, override the `vfunc@Gio.Application.before_emit` or
  `vfunc@Gio.Application.after_emit` virtual functions
  in your [gio.application.Application] subclass. When dealing with
  [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] objects, the platform data is
  directly available via [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getCwd],
  [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getEnviron] and
  [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getPlatformData].
  
  As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
  operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
  `cwd`), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
  variables and their values) of the calling process (key `environ`).
  The environment is only added to the platform data if the
  [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.SendEnvironment] flag is set. [gio.application.Application] subclasses
  can add their own platform data by overriding the
  `vfunc@Gio.Application.add_platform_data` virtual function. For instance,
  [gtk.application.Application] adds startup notification data in this way.
  
  To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
  `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` signal or override the
  `vfunc@Gio.Application.local_command_line` virtual funcion, to parse them in
  either the primary instance or the local instance, respectively.

/**
    [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] represents a command-line invocation of
  an application.
  
  It is created by [gio.application.Application] and emitted
  in the `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` signal and virtual function.
  
  The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
  with. It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
  local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
  invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
  commandline to this process).
  
  The [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] object can provide the @argc and @argv
  parameters for use with the [glib.option_context.OptionContext] command-line parsing API,
  with the [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getArguments] function. See
  [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
  for an example.
  
  The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
  messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.
  
  For remote invocation, the originally-invoked process exits when
  [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.done] method is called. This method is
  also automatically called when the object is disposed.
  
  The main use for [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] (and the
  `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
  You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
  your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
  have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
  in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
  aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
  does not return until the editing is done.
  
  Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
  `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` handler. The launching instance exits
  once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
  the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
  of the launching instance.
  
  ```c
  static int
  command_line (GApplication            *application,
                GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
  {
    gchar **argv;
    gint argc;
    gint i;
  
    argv = g_application_command_line_get_arguments (cmdline, &argc);
  
    g_application_command_line_print (cmdline,
                                      "This text is written back\n"
                                      "to stdout of the caller\n");
  
    for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
      g_print ("argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
  
    g_strfreev (argv);
  
    return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  The complete example can be found here:
  [gapplication-example-cmdline.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline.c)
  
  In more complicated cases, the handling of the commandline can be
  split between the launcher and the primary instance.
  
  ```c
  static gboolean
   test_local_cmdline (GApplication   *application,
                       gchar        ***arguments,
                       gint           *exit_status)
  {
    gint i, j;
    gchar **argv;
  
    argv = *arguments;
  
    if (argv[0] == NULL)
      {
        *exit_status = 0;
        return FALSE;
      }
  
    i = 1;
    while (argv[i])
      {
        if (g_str_has_prefix (argv[i], "--local-"))
          {
            g_print ("handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
            g_free (argv[i]);
            for (j = i; argv[j]; j++)
              argv[j] = argv[j + 1];
          }
        else
          {
            g_print ("not handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
            i++;
          }
      }
  
    *exit_status = 0;
  
    return FALSE;
  }
  
  static void
  test_application_class_init (TestApplicationClass *class)
  {
    G_APPLICATION_CLASS (class)->local_command_line = test_local_cmdline;
  
    ...
  }
  ```
  
  In this example of split commandline handling, options that start
  with `--local-` are handled locally, all other options are passed
  to the `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` handler which runs in the primary
  instance.
  
  The complete example can be found here:
  [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c)
  
  If handling the commandline requires a lot of work, it may be better to defer it.
  
  ```c
  static gboolean
  my_cmdline_handler (gpointer data)
  {
    GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline = data;
  
    // do the heavy lifting in an idle
  
    g_application_command_line_set_exit_status (cmdline, 0);
    g_object_unref (cmdline); // this releases the application
  
    return G_SOURCE_REMOVE;
  }
  
  static int
  command_line (GApplication            *application,
                GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
  {
    // keep the application running until we are done with this commandline
    g_application_hold (application);
  
    g_object_set_data_full (G_OBJECT (cmdline),
                            "application", application,
                            (GDestroyNotify)g_application_release);
  
    g_object_ref (cmdline);
    g_idle_add (my_cmdline_handler, cmdline);
  
    return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  In this example the commandline is not completely handled before
  the `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` handler returns. Instead, we keep
  a reference to the [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] object and handle it
  later (in this example, in an idle). Note that it is necessary to
  hold the application until you are done with the commandline.

    [gio.async_initable.AsyncInitable] is an interface for asynchronously initializable objects.
  
  This is the asynchronous version of [gio.initable.Initable]; it behaves the same
  in all ways except that initialization is asynchronous. For more details
  see the descriptions on [gio.initable.Initable].
  
  A class may implement both the [gio.initable.Initable] and [gio.async_initable.AsyncInitable] interfaces.
  
  Users of objects implementing this are not intended to use the interface
  method directly; instead it will be used automatically in various ways.
  For C applications you generally just call [gio.async_initable.AsyncInitable.newAsync]
  directly, or indirectly via a foo_thing_new_async() wrapper. This will call
  [gio.async_initable.AsyncInitable.initAsync] under the covers, calling back with `NULL`
  and a set [glib.error.ErrorG] on failure.
  
  A typical implementation might look something like this:
  
  ```c
  enum {
     NOT_INITIALIZED,
     INITIALIZING,
     INITIALIZED
  };

/**
    [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] provides a base class for implementing asynchronous function results.
  
  Asynchronous operations are broken up into two separate operations
  which are chained together by a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback]. To begin
  an asynchronous operation, provide a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback] to the
  asynchronous function. This callback will be triggered when the
  operation has completed, and must be run in a later iteration of
  the thread-default main context (see
  [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) from where the operation was
  initiated. It will be passed a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] instance filled with the
  details of the operation's success or failure, the object the asynchronous
  function was started for and any error codes returned. The asynchronous
  callback function is then expected to call the corresponding `_finish()`
  function, passing the object the function was called for, the
  [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] instance, and (optionally) an @error to grab any
  error conditions that may have occurred.
  
  The `_finish()` function for an operation takes the generic result
  (of type [gio.async_result.AsyncResult]) and returns the specific result that the
  operation in question yields (e.g. a [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator] for a
  "enumerate children" operation). If the result or error status of the
  operation is not needed, there is no need to call the `_finish()`
  function; GIO will take care of cleaning up the result and error
  information after the [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback] returns. You can pass
  `NULL` for the [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback] if you don't need to take any
  action at all after the operation completes. Applications may also
  take a reference to the [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] and call `_finish()` later;
  however, the `_finish()` function may be called at most once.
  
  Example of a typical asynchronous operation flow:
  
  ```c
  void _theoretical_frobnitz_async (Theoretical         *t,
                                    GCancellable        *c,
                                    GAsyncReadyCallback  cb,
                                    gpointer             u);
  
  gboolean _theoretical_frobnitz_finish (Theoretical   *t,
                                         GAsyncResult  *res,
                                         GError       **e);
  
  static void
  frobnitz_result_func (GObject      *source_object,
  		 GAsyncResult *res,
  		 gpointer      user_data)
  {
    gboolean success = FALSE;
  
    success = _theoretical_frobnitz_finish (source_object, res, NULL);
  
    if (success)
      g_printf ("Hurray!\n");
    else
      g_printf ("Uh oh!\n");
  
    ...
  
  }
  
  int main (int argc, void *argv[])
  {
     ...
  
     _theoretical_frobnitz_async (theoretical_data,
                                  NULL,
                                  frobnitz_result_func,
                                  NULL);
  
     ...
  }
  ```
  
  The callback for an asynchronous operation is called only once, and is
  always called, even in the case of a cancelled operation. On cancellation
  the result is a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Cancelled] error.
  
  ## I/O Priority
  
  Many I/O-related asynchronous operations have a priority parameter,
  which is used in certain cases to determine the order in which
  operations are executed. They are not used to determine system-wide
  I/O scheduling. Priorities are integers, with lower numbers indicating
  higher priority. It is recommended to choose priorities between
  `G_PRIORITY_LOW` and `G_PRIORITY_HIGH`, with `G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT`
  as a default.

/**
    [gio.dbus_auth_observer.DBusAuthObserver] provides a mechanism for participating
  in how a [gio.dbus_server.DBusServer] (or a [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection])
  authenticates remote peers.
  
  Simply instantiate a [gio.dbus_auth_observer.DBusAuthObserver] and connect to the
  signals you are interested in. Note that new signals may be added
  in the future.
  
  ## Controlling Authentication Mechanisms
  
  By default, a [gio.dbus_server.DBusServer] or server-side [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] will allow
  any authentication mechanism to be used. If you only want to allow D-Bus
  connections with the `EXTERNAL` mechanism, which makes use of credentials
  passing and is the recommended mechanism for modern Unix platforms such
  as Linux and the BSD family, you would use a signal handler like this:
  
  ```c
  static gboolean
  on_allow_mechanism (GDBusAuthObserver *observer,
                      const gchar       *mechanism,
                      gpointer           user_data)
  {
    if (g_strcmp0 (mechanism, "EXTERNAL") == 0)
      {
        return TRUE;
      }
  
    return FALSE;
  }
  ```
  
  ## Controlling Authorization
  
  By default, a [gio.dbus_server.DBusServer] or server-side [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] will accept
  connections from any successfully authenticated user (but not from
  anonymous connections using the `ANONYMOUS` mechanism). If you only
  want to allow D-Bus connections from processes owned by the same uid
  as the server, since GLib 2.68, you should use the
  [gio.types.DBusServerFlags.AuthenticationRequireSameUser] flag. It’s equivalent
  to the following signal handler:
  
  ```c
  static gboolean
  on_authorize_authenticated_peer (GDBusAuthObserver *observer,
                                   GIOStream         *stream,
                                   GCredentials      *credentials,
                                   gpointer           user_data)
  {
    gboolean authorized;
  
    authorized = FALSE;
    if (credentials != NULL)
      {
        GCredentials *own_credentials;
        own_credentials = g_credentials_new ();
        if (g_credentials_is_same_user (credentials, own_credentials, NULL))
          authorized = TRUE;
        g_object_unref (own_credentials);
      }
  
    return authorized;
  }
  ```
*/
struct GDBusAuthObserver;

/**
    The [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] type is used for D-Bus connections to remote
  peers such as a message buses.
  
  It is a low-level API that offers a lot of flexibility. For instance,
  it lets you establish a connection over any transport that can by represented
  as a [gio.iostream.IOStream].
  
  This class is rarely used directly in D-Bus clients. If you are writing
  a D-Bus client, it is often easier to use the `func@Gio.bus_own_name`,
  `func@Gio.bus_watch_name` or [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy.newForBus] APIs.
  
  As an exception to the usual GLib rule that a particular object must not
  be used by two threads at the same time, [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection]s methods may be
  called from any thread. This is so that `func@Gio.bus_get` and
  `func@Gio.bus_get_sync` can safely return the same [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] when
  called from any thread.
  
  Most of the ways to obtain a [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] automatically initialize it
  (i.e. connect to D-Bus): for instance, [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection.new_] and
  `func@Gio.bus_get`, and the synchronous versions of those methods, give you
  an initialized connection. Language bindings for GIO should use
  [gio.initable.Initable.new_] or [gio.async_initable.AsyncInitable.newAsync], which also
  initialize the connection.
  
  If you construct an uninitialized [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection], such as via
  [gobject.object.ObjectG.new_], you must initialize it via [gio.initable.Initable.init_] or
  [gio.async_initable.AsyncInitable.initAsync] before using its methods or properties.
  Calling methods or accessing properties on a [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] that has not
  completed initialization successfully is considered to be invalid, and leads
  to undefined behaviour. In particular, if initialization fails with a
  [glib.error.ErrorG], the only valid thing you can do with that [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection] is to
  free it with [gobject.object.ObjectG.unref].

    Virtual table for handling properties and method calls for a D-Bus

  Since 2.38, if you want to handle getting/setting D-Bus properties
  asynchronously, give null as your get_property() or set_property()
  function. The D-Bus call will be directed to your @method_call function,
  with the provided @interface_name set to "org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties".
  
  Ownership of the #GDBusMethodInvocation object passed to the
  method_call() function is transferred to your handler; you must
  call one of the methods of #GDBusMethodInvocation to return a reply
  (possibly empty), or an error. These functions also take ownership
  of the passed-in invocation object, so unless the invocation
  object has otherwise been referenced, it will be then be freed.
  Calling one of these functions may be done within your
  method_call() implementation but it also can be done at a later
  point to handle the method asynchronously.
  
  The usual checks on the validity of the calls is performed. For
  `Get` calls, an error is automatically returned if the property does
  not exist or the permissions do not allow access. The same checks are
  performed for `Set` calls, and the provided value is also checked for
  being the correct type.
  
  For both `Get` and `Set` calls, the #GDBusMethodInvocation
  passed to the @method_call handler can be queried with
  [gio.dbus_method_invocation.DBusMethodInvocation.getPropertyInfo] to get a pointer
  to the #GDBusPropertyInfo of the property.
  
  If you have readable properties specified in your interface info,
  you must ensure that you either provide a non-null @get_property()
  function or provide implementations of both the `Get` and `GetAll`
  methods on org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties interface in your @method_call
  function. Note that the required return type of the `Get` call is
  `(v)`, not the type of the property. `GetAll` expects a return value
  of type `a{sv}`.
  
  If you have writable properties specified in your interface info,
  you must ensure that you either provide a non-null @set_property()
  function or provide an implementation of the `Set` call. If implementing
  the call, you must return the value of type `G_VARIANT_TYPE_UNIT`.

/**
    [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] is used to create, monitor and delete object
  proxies for remote objects exported by a [gio.dbus_object_manager_server.DBusObjectManagerServer]
  (or any code implementing the
  [org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-objectmanager)
  interface).
  
  Once an instance of this type has been created, you can connect to
  the `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::object-added` and
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::object-removed signals` and inspect the
  [gio.dbus_object_proxy.DBusObjectProxy] objects returned by
  [gio.dbus_object_manager.DBusObjectManager.getObjects].
  
  If the name for a [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] is not owned by anyone at
  object construction time, the default behavior is to request the
  message bus to launch an owner for the name. This behavior can be
  disabled using the [gio.types.DBusObjectManagerClientFlags.DoNotAutoStart]
  flag. It’s also worth noting that this only works if the name of
  interest is activatable in the first place. E.g. in some cases it
  is not possible to launch an owner for the requested name. In this
  case, [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] object construction still succeeds but
  there will be no object proxies
  (e.g. [gio.dbus_object_manager.DBusObjectManager.getObjects] returns the empty list) and
  the [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] property is `NULL`.
  
  The owner of the requested name can come and go (for example
  consider a system service being restarted) – [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient]
  handles this case too; simply connect to the [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify]
  signal to watch for changes on the
  [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] property. When the name
  owner vanishes, the behavior is that
  [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] is set to `NULL` (this
  includes emission of the [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify] signal) and then
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::object-removed` signals are synthesized
  for all currently existing object proxies. Since
  [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] is `NULL` when this
  happens, you can use this information to disambiguate a synthesized signal
  from a genuine signal caused by object removal on the remote
  [gio.dbus_object_manager.DBusObjectManager]. Similarly, when a new name owner appears,
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::object-added` signals are synthesized
  while [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] is still `NULL`. Only
  when all object proxies have been added, the
  [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] is set to the new name
  owner (this includes emission of the [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify] signal).
  Furthermore, you are guaranteed that
  [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient.utf8] will alternate between a
  name owner (e.g. `:1.42`) and `NULL` even in the case where
  the name of interest is atomically replaced
  
  Ultimately, [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] is used to obtain
  [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] instances. All signals (including the
  `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties::PropertiesChanged` signal)
  delivered to [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] instances are guaranteed to originate
  from the name owner. This guarantee along with the behavior
  described above, means that certain race conditions including the
  “half the proxy is from the old owner and the other half is from
  the new owner” problem cannot happen.
  
  To avoid having the application connect to signals on the returned
  [gio.dbus_object_proxy.DBusObjectProxy] and [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] objects, the
  `signal@Gio.DBusObject::interface-added`,
  `signal@Gio.DBusObject::interface-removed`,
  `signal@Gio.DBusProxy::g-properties-changed` and
  `signal@Gio.DBusProxy::g-signal` signals
  are also emitted on the [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] instance managing these
  objects. The signals emitted are
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::interface-added`,
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManager::interface-removed`,
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient::interface-proxy-properties-changed` and
  `signal@Gio.DBusObjectManagerClient::interface-proxy-signal`.
  
  Note that all callbacks and signals are emitted in the
  thread-default main context (see
  [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) that the
  [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] object was constructed in. Additionally, the
  [gio.dbus_object_proxy.DBusObjectProxy] and [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] objects
  originating from the [gio.dbus_object_manager_client.DBusObjectManagerClient] object will be created in
  the same context and, consequently, will deliver signals in the
  same main loop.

    [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] is a base class used for proxies to access a D-Bus
  interface on a remote object. A [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] can be constructed for
  both well-known and unique names.
  
  By default, [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] will cache all properties (and listen to
  changes) of the remote object, and proxy all signals that get
  emitted. This behaviour can be changed by passing suitable
  [gio.types.DBusProxyFlags] when the proxy is created. If the proxy is for a
  well-known name, the property cache is flushed when the name owner
  vanishes and reloaded when a name owner appears.
  
  The unique name owner of the proxy’s name is tracked and can be read from
  `property@Gio.DBusProxy:g-name-owner`. Connect to the
  [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify] signal to get notified of changes.
  Additionally, only signals and property changes emitted from the current name
  owner are considered and calls are always sent to the current name owner.
  This avoids a number of race conditions when the name is lost by one owner
  and claimed by another. However, if no name owner currently exists,
  then calls will be sent to the well-known name which may result in
  the message bus launching an owner (unless
  [gio.types.DBusProxyFlags.DoNotAutoStart] is set).
  
  If the proxy is for a stateless D-Bus service, where the name owner may
  be started and stopped between calls, the
  `property@Gio.DBusProxy:g-name-owner` tracking of [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] will cause the
  proxy to drop signal and property changes from the service after it has
  restarted for the first time. When interacting with a stateless D-Bus
  service, do not use [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] — use direct D-Bus method calls and signal
  connections.
  
  The generic `signal@Gio.DBusProxy::g-properties-changed` and
  `signal@Gio.DBusProxy::g-signal` signals are not very convenient to work
  with. Therefore, the recommended way of working with proxies is to subclass
  [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy], and have more natural properties and signals in your derived
  class. This [example](migrating-gdbus.html#using-gdbus-codegen) shows how
  this can easily be done using the [`gdbus-codegen`](gdbus-codegen.html) tool.
  
  A [gio.dbus_proxy.DBusProxy] instance can be used from multiple threads but note
  that all signals (e.g. `signal@Gio.DBusProxy::g-signal`,
  `signal@Gio.DBusProxy::g-properties-changed` and
  [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify]) are emitted in the thread-default main
  context (see [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) of the thread
  where the instance was constructed.
  
  An example using a proxy for a well-known name can be found in
  [`gdbus-example-watch-proxy.c`](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-example-watch-proxy.c).

/**
    Interface for socket-like objects with datagram semantics.
  
  A [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
  communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
  BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
  [gio.socket.Socket], which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
  
  [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
  alongside higher-level networking APIs such as [gio.iostream.IOStream].
  
  It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
  to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
  the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
  or system calls. For example, [gio.socket.Socket] uses `recvmmsg()` and `sendmmsg()`
  where possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
  multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
  assemble or disassemble a message.
  
  Each [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
  for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
  timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
  error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
  [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
  will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
  timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
  [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.TimedOut] if no progress was made. To know when a call would
  successfully run you can call [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] or
  [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionWait]. You can also use
  [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.createSource] and attach it to a [glib.main_context.MainContext]
  to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
  
  When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
  handle getting a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error even when some other function
  said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
  condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
  instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
  returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
  
  As with [gio.socket.Socket], [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased]s can be either connection oriented (for
  example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased]s must be
  datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
  establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
  before sending and receiving data through the [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] API. For
  connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
  received in each I/O operation.
  
  Like most other APIs in GLib, [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is not inherently thread safe.
  To use a [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] concurrently from multiple threads, you must
  implement your own locking.

  `property@Gio.DebugController:debug-enabled` and, by default,
  `func@GLib.log_get_debug_enabled`.
  
  By default, no processes are allowed to call `SetDebugEnabled()` unless a
  [gio.debug_controller_dbus.DebugControllerDBus.authorize] signal handler is installed. This
  is because the process may be privileged, or might expose sensitive
  information in its debug output. You may want to restrict the ability to
  enable debug output to privileged users or processes.
  
  One option is to install a D-Bus security policy which restricts access to
  `SetDebugEnabled()`, installing something like the following in
  `$datadir/dbus-1/system.d/`:
  
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0"?> <!--*-nxml-*-->
  <!DOCTYPE busconfig PUBLIC "-//freedesktop//DTD D-BUS Bus Configuration 1.0//EN"
       "http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/dbus/1.0/busconfig.dtd">
  <busconfig>
    <policy user="root">
      <allow send_destination="com.example.MyService" send_interface="org.gtk.Debugging"/>
    </policy>
    <policy context="default">
      <deny send_destination="com.example.MyService" send_interface="org.gtk.Debugging"/>
    </policy>
  </busconfig>
  ```
  
  This will prevent the `SetDebugEnabled()` method from being called by all
  except root. It will not prevent the `DebugEnabled` property from being read,
  as it’s accessed through the `org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties` interface.
  
  Another option is to use polkit to allow or deny requests on a case-by-case
  basis, allowing for the possibility of dynamic authorisation. To do this,
  connect to the [gio.debug_controller_dbus.DebugControllerDBus.authorize] signal and query
  polkit in it:
  
  ```c
    g_autoptr(GError) child_error = NULL;
    g_autoptr(GDBusConnection) connection = g_bus_get_sync (G_BUS_TYPE_SYSTEM, NULL, NULL);
    gulong debug_controller_authorize_id = 0;
  
    // Set up the debug controller.
    debug_controller = G_DEBUG_CONTROLLER (g_debug_controller_dbus_new (priv->connection, NULL, &child_error));
    if (debug_controller == NULL)
      {
        g_error ("Could not register debug controller on bus: %s"),
                 child_error->message);
      }
  
    debug_controller_authorize_id = g_signal_connect (debug_controller,
                                                      "authorize",

    [gio.drive.Drive] represents a piece of hardware connected to the machine.
  It’s generally only created for removable hardware or hardware with
  removable media.
  
  [gio.drive.Drive] is a container class for [gio.volume.Volume] objects that stem from
  the same piece of media. As such, [gio.drive.Drive] abstracts a drive with
  (or without) removable media and provides operations for querying
  whether media is available, determining whether media change is
  automatically detected and ejecting the media.
  
  If the [gio.drive.Drive] reports that media isn’t automatically detected, one
  can poll for media; typically one should not do this periodically
  as a poll for media operation is potentially expensive and may
  spin up the drive creating noise.
  
  [gio.drive.Drive] supports starting and stopping drives with authentication
  support for the former. This can be used to support a diverse set
  of use cases including connecting/disconnecting iSCSI devices,
  powering down external disk enclosures and starting/stopping
  multi-disk devices such as RAID devices. Note that the actual
  semantics and side-effects of starting/stopping a [gio.drive.Drive] may vary
  according to implementation. To choose the correct verbs in e.g. a
  file manager, use [gio.drive.Drive.getStartStopType].

/**
    [gio.file.File] is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
  virtual file system. [gio.file.File]s are lightweight, immutable objects
  that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
  [gio.file.File] objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
  file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
  (see [gio.input_stream.InputStream] and [gio.output_stream.OutputStream]).
  
  To construct a [gio.file.File], you can use:
  
  $(LIST
    * [gio.file.File.newForPath] if you have a path.
    * [gio.file.File.newForUri] if you have a URI.
    * [gio.file.File.newForCommandlineArg] or
      [gio.file.File.newForCommandlineArgAndCwd] for a command line
      argument.
    * [gio.file.File.newTmp] to create a temporary file from a template.
    * [gio.file.File.newTmpAsync] to asynchronously create a temporary file.
    * [gio.file.File.newTmpDirAsync] to asynchronously create a temporary
      directory.
    * [gio.file.File.parseName] from a UTF-8 string gotten from
      [gio.file.File.getParseName].
    * [gio.file.File.newBuildFilename] or [gio.file.File.newBuildFilenamev]
      to create a file from path elements.
  )
    
  One way to think of a [gio.file.File] is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
  normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
  [gio.file.File]s are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
  to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
  
  [gio.file.File]s make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
  the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
  [gio.file.File] using [gio.file.File.getParent] to get an identifier for the
  parent directory, [gio.file.File.getChild] to get a child within a
  directory, and [gio.file.File.resolveRelativePath] to resolve a relative
  path between two [gio.file.File]s. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not
  end up at the same root if you repeatedly call [gio.file.File.getParent]
  on two different files.
  
  All [gio.file.File]s have a basename (get with [gio.file.File.getBasename]). These
  names are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
  (relative to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they
  have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
  you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
  name that you can get by requesting the
  `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME` attribute with
  [gio.file.File.queryInfo]. This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be
  used in a user interface. But always store the real basename or the [gio.file.File]
  to use to actually access the file, because there is no way to go from a
  display name to the actual name.
  
  Using [gio.file.File] as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
  in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
  hard or soft links may cause two different [gio.file.File]s to refer to the same
  file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
  short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
  check if two [gio.file.File]s point to the same file you can query for the
  `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE` attribute. Note that [gio.file.File] does some trivial
  canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
  the path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of
  path, `.` or `..` path segments, etc) does not create different [gio.file.File]s.
  
  Many [gio.file.File] operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
  to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
  simply have `_async()` appended to their function names. The asynchronous
  I/O functions call a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback] which is then used to
  finalize the operation, producing a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] which is then
  passed to the function’s matching `_finish()` operation.
  
  It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
  shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
  I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
  Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the
  [introduction to asynchronous programming section](overview.html#asynchronous-programming)
  for more.
  
  Some [gio.file.File] operations almost always take a noticeable amount of time, and
  so do not have synchronous analogs. Notable cases include:
  
  $(LIST
    * [gio.file.File.mountMountable] to mount a mountable file.
    * [gio.file.File.unmountMountableWithOperation] to unmount a mountable
      file.
    * [gio.file.File.ejectMountableWithOperation] to eject a mountable file.
  )
    
  ## Entity Tags
  
  One notable feature of [gio.file.File]s are entity tags, or ‘etags’ for
  short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
  traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file
  has been modified from the version on the file system. See the
  HTTP 1.1
  [specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)

    [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator] allows you to operate on a set of [gio.file.File] objects,
  returning a [gio.file_info.FileInfo] structure for each file enumerated (e.g.
  [gio.file.File.enumerateChildren] will return a [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator] for each
  of the children within a directory).
  
  To get the next file's information from a [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator], use
  [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator.nextFile] or its asynchronous version,
  [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator.nextFilesAsync]. Note that the asynchronous
  version will return a list of [gio.file_info.FileInfo] objects, whereas the
  synchronous will only return the next file in the enumerator.
  
  The ordering of returned files is unspecified for non-Unix
  platforms; for more information, see [glib.dir.Dir.readName].  On Unix,
  when operating on local files, returned files will be sorted by
  inode number.  Effectively you can assume that the ordering of
  returned files will be stable between successive calls (and
  applications) assuming the directory is unchanged.
  
  If your application needs a specific ordering, such as by name or
  modification time, you will have to implement that in your
  application code.
  
  To close a [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator], use [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator.close], or
  its asynchronous version, [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator.closeAsync]. Once
  a [gio.file_enumerator.FileEnumerator] is closed, no further actions may be performed
  on it, and it should be freed with [gobject.object.ObjectG.unref].

    Stores information about a file system object referenced by a [gio.file.File].
  
  Functionality for manipulating basic metadata for files. [gio.file_info.FileInfo]
  implements methods for getting information that all files should
  contain, and allows for manipulation of extended attributes.
  
  See [file-attributes.html](file attributes) for more information on how GIO
  handles file attributes.
  
  To obtain a [gio.file_info.FileInfo] for a [gio.file.File], use
  [gio.file.File.queryInfo] (or its async variant). To obtain a [gio.file_info.FileInfo]
  for a file input or output stream, use [gio.file_input_stream.FileInputStream.queryInfo]
  or [gio.file_output_stream.FileOutputStream.queryInfo] (or their async variants).
  
  To change the actual attributes of a file, you should then set the
  attribute in the [gio.file_info.FileInfo] and call [gio.file.File.setAttributesFromInfo]
  or [gio.file.File.setAttributesAsync] on a [gio.file.File].
  
  However, not all attributes can be changed in the file. For instance,
  the actual size of a file cannot be changed via [gio.file_info.FileInfo.setSize].
  You may call [gio.file.File.querySettableAttributes] and
  [gio.file.File.queryWritableNamespaces] to discover the settable attributes
  of a particular file at runtime.
  
  The direct accessors, such as [gio.file_info.FileInfo.getName], are slightly more
  optimized than the generic attribute accessors, such as
  [gio.file_info.FileInfo.getAttributeByteString].This optimization will matter
  only if calling the API in a tight loop.
  
  It is an error to call these accessors without specifying their required file
  attributes when creating the [gio.file_info.FileInfo]. Use
  [gio.file_info.FileInfo.hasAttribute] or [gio.file_info.FileInfo.listAttributes]
  to check what attributes are specified for a [gio.file_info.FileInfo].
  
  [gio.file_attribute_matcher.FileAttributeMatcher] allows for searching through a [gio.file_info.FileInfo]

/**
    [gio.ioextension_point.IOExtensionPoint] provides a mechanism for modules to extend the
  functionality of the library or application that loaded it in an
  organized fashion.
  
  An extension point is identified by a name, and it may optionally
  require that any implementation must be of a certain type (or derived
  thereof). Use [gio.ioextension_point.IOExtensionPoint.register] to register an
  extension point, and [gio.ioextension_point.IOExtensionPoint.setRequiredType] to
  set a required type.
  
  A module can implement an extension point by specifying the
  [gobject.types.size_t] that implements the functionality. Additionally, each
  implementation of an extension point has a name, and a priority. Use
  [gio.ioextension_point.IOExtensionPoint.implement] to implement an extension point.
  
  ```c
  GIOExtensionPoint *ep;
  
  // Register an extension point
  ep = g_io_extension_point_register ("my-extension-point");
  g_io_extension_point_set_required_type (ep, MY_TYPE_EXAMPLE);
  ```
  
  ```c
  // Implement an extension point
  G_DEFINE_TYPE (MyExampleImpl, my_example_impl, MY_TYPE_EXAMPLE)
  g_io_extension_point_implement ("my-extension-point",
                                  my_example_impl_get_type (),
                                  "my-example",
                                  10);
  ```
  
   It is up to the code that registered the extension point how
   it uses the implementations that have been associated with it.
   Depending on the use case, it may use all implementations, or
   only the one with the highest priority, or pick a specific
   one by name.
  
   To avoid opening all modules just to find out what extension
   points they implement, GIO makes use of a caching mechanism,
   see [gio-querymodules](gio-querymodules.html).
   You are expected to run this command after installing a
   GIO module.
  
   The `GIO_EXTRA_MODULES` environment variable can be used to
   specify additional directories to automatically load modules
   from. This environment variable has the same syntax as the
   `PATH`. If two modules have the same base name in different
   directories, then the latter one will be ignored. If additional
   directories are specified GIO will load modules from the built-in
   directory last.

/**
    [gio.iostream.IOStream] represents an object that has both read and write streams.
  Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
  but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
  seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
  
  Examples of [gio.iostream.IOStream] objects are [gio.socket_connection.SocketConnection], which represents
  a two-way network connection; and [gio.file_iostream.FileIOStream], which represents a
  file handle opened in read-write mode.
  
  To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
  with [gio.iostream.IOStream.getInputStream] and
  [gio.iostream.IOStream.getOutputStream].
  
  The [gio.iostream.IOStream] object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
  way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the [gio.iostream.IOStream]
  object alive. If the [gio.iostream.IOStream] object is freed it will be closed, thus
  closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
  always return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed] for all operations.
  
  To close a stream use [gio.iostream.IOStream.close] which will close the common
  stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
  the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
  substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
  [gio.iostream.IOStream] may still be open. However, some streams may support
  ‘half-closed’ states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
  
  Operations on [gio.iostream.IOStream]s cannot be started while another operation on the
  [gio.iostream.IOStream] or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
  read from the [gio.input_stream.InputStream] and write to the
  [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] simultaneously (either in separate threads, or as
  asynchronous operations in the same thread), but an application cannot start
  any [gio.iostream.IOStream] operation while there is a [gio.iostream.IOStream], [gio.input_stream.InputStream] or
  [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] operation in progress, and an application can’t start any
  [gio.input_stream.InputStream] or [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] operation while there is a [gio.iostream.IOStream]
  operation in progress.
  
  This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
  given [glib.main_context.MainContext] (the thread-default context at the time the
  operation was started), rather than entire streams being associated with a
  single [glib.main_context.MainContext].
  
  GIO may run operations on [gio.iostream.IOStream]s from other (worker) threads, and this
  may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
  as [gio.buffered_input_stream.BufferedInputStream] or [gio.tls_connection.TlsConnection]. With such
  wrapper APIs, application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped)
  stream when the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such
  operations may not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves
  the base stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

  [gio.icon.Icon] does not provide the actual pixmap for the icon as this is out

  of an icon (see [gio.themed_icon.ThemedIcon]), or the path to an icon
  (see [gio.loadable_icon.LoadableIcon]).
  
  To obtain a hash of a [gio.icon.Icon], see [gio.icon.Icon.hash].
  
  To check if two [gio.icon.Icon]s are equal, see [gio.icon.Icon.equal].
  
  For serializing a [gio.icon.Icon], use [gio.icon.Icon.serialize] and

  afterwards. @num_control_messages is set to the number of elements in

    [gio.list_model.ListModel] is an interface that represents a mutable list of
  [gobject.object.ObjectG]. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets
  in user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
  convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
  updates.
  
  Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
  mechanism (normally the [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify] signal).  Taken
  together with the `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal, this provides
  for a list that can change its membership, and in which the members can
  change their individual properties.
  
  A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
  points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
  signal strength.
  
  It is important to note that the [gio.list_model.ListModel] itself does not report
  changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
  membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
  then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
  interested in.
  
  All items in a [gio.list_model.ListModel] are of (or derived from) the same type.
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItemType] returns that type.  The type may be an
  interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
  
  The semantics are close to that of an array:
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getNItems] returns the number of items in the list
  and [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItem] returns an item at a (0-based) position.
  In order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
  you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItem] until it returns `NULL`.
  
  An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
  return the same object for a given position until all references to
  it are gone.
  
  On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
  objects that are currently ‘user visible’, in order to facilitate the
  maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
  reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
  
  This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
  thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
  implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
  the thread-default main context (see
  [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) in effect at the time that the
  model was created.
  
  Over time, it has established itself as good practice for list model
  implementations to provide properties `item-type` and `n-items` to
  ease working with them. While it is not required, it is recommended
  that implementations provide these two properties. They should return
  the values of [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItemType] and
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getNItems] respectively and be defined as such:
  
  ```c
  properties[PROP_ITEM_TYPE] =
    g_param_spec_gtype ("item-type", NULL, NULL, G_TYPE_OBJECT,
                        G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY | G_PARAM_READWRITE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
  properties[PROP_N_ITEMS] =
    g_param_spec_uint ("n-items", NULL, NULL, 0, G_MAXUINT, 0,
                       G_PARAM_READABLE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);

  ([API documentation](https://hadess.pages.freedesktop.org/low-memory-monitor/)).
  
  There is also an implementation for use inside Flatpak sandboxes.
  
  Possible actions to take when the signal is received are:

      * Save files that haven’t been looked at in a while to disk, ready to be reopened when needed
      * Run a garbage collection cycle

      * Exit on idle if the process has no reason to stay around
      * Call [`malloc_trim(3)`](man:malloc_trim(3)) to return cached heap pages to

   )
     
  Note that some actions may not always improve system performance, and so

/**
    [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] represents the contents of a menu — an ordered list of
  menu items. The items are associated with actions, which can be
  activated through them. Items can be grouped in sections, and may
  have submenus associated with them. Both items and sections usually
  have some representation data, such as labels or icons. The type of
  the associated action (ie whether it is stateful, and what kind of
  state it has) can influence the representation of the item.
  
  The conceptual model of menus in [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] is hierarchical:
  sections and submenus are again represented by [gio.menu_model.MenuModel]s.
  Menus themselves do not define their own roles. Rather, the role
  of a particular [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] is defined by the item that references
  it (or, in the case of the ‘root’ menu, is defined by the context
  in which it is used).
  
  As an example, consider the visible portions of this menu:
  
  ## An example menu
  
  ![](menu-example.png)
  
  There are 8 ‘menus’ visible in the screenshot: one menubar, two
  submenus and 5 sections:
  
  $(LIST
    * the toplevel menubar (containing 4 items)
    * the View submenu (containing 3 sections)
    * the first section of the View submenu (containing 2 items)
    * the second section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
    * the final section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
    * the Highlight Mode submenu (containing 2 sections)
    * the Sources section (containing 2 items)
    * the Markup section (containing 2 items)
  )
    
  The [example](#a-menu-example) illustrates the conceptual connection between
  these 8 menus. Each large block in the figure represents a menu and the
  smaller blocks within the large block represent items in that menu. Some
  items contain references to other menus.
  
  ## A menu example
  
  ![](menu-model.png)
  
  Notice that the separators visible in the [example](#an-example-menu)
  appear nowhere in the [menu model](#a-menu-example). This is because
  separators are not explicitly represented in the menu model. Instead,
  a separator is inserted between any two non-empty sections of a menu.
  Section items can have labels just like any other item. In that case,
  a display system may show a section header instead of a separator.
  
  The motivation for this abstract model of application controls is
  that modern user interfaces tend to make these controls available
  outside the application. Examples include global menus, jumplists,
  dash boards, etc. To support such uses, it is necessary to ‘export’
  information about actions and their representation in menus, which
  is exactly what the action group exporter and the menu model exporter do for
  [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] and [gio.menu_model.MenuModel]. The client-side
  counterparts to make use of the exported information are
  [gio.dbus_action_group.DBusActionGroup] and [gio.dbus_menu_model.DBusMenuModel].
  
  The API of [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] is very generic, with iterators for the
  attributes and links of an item, see
  [gio.menu_model.MenuModel.iterateItemAttributes] and
  [gio.menu_model.MenuModel.iterateItemLinks]. The ‘standard’ attributes and
  link types have predefined names: `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_LABEL`,
  `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION`, `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_TARGET`, `G_MENU_LINK_SECTION`
  and `G_MENU_LINK_SUBMENU`.
  
  Items in a [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] represent active controls if they refer to
  an action that can get activated when the user interacts with the
  menu item. The reference to the action is encoded by the string ID
  in the `G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION` attribute. An action ID uniquely
  identifies an action in an action group. Which action group(s) provide
  actions depends on the context in which the menu model is used.
  E.g. when the model is exported as the application menu of a
  [[gtk.application.Application]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html),
  actions can be application-wide or window-specific (and thus come from
  two different action groups). By convention, the application-wide actions
  have names that start with `app.`, while the names of window-specific
  actions start with `win.`.
  
  While a wide variety of stateful actions is possible, the following
  is the minimum that is expected to be supported by all users of exported
  menu information:
  $(LIST
    * an action with no parameter type and no state
    * an action with no parameter type and boolean state
    * an action with string parameter type and string state
  )
    
  ## Stateless
  
  A stateless action typically corresponds to an ordinary menu item.
  
  Selecting such a menu item will activate the action (with no parameter).
  
  ## Boolean State
  
  An action with a boolean state will most typically be used with a ‘toggle’
  or ‘switch’ menu item. The state can be set directly, but activating the
  action (with no parameter) results in the state being toggled.
  
  Selecting a toggle menu item will activate the action. The menu item should
  be rendered as ‘checked’ when the state is true.
  
  ## String Parameter and State
  
  Actions with string parameters and state will most typically be used to
  represent an enumerated choice over the items available for a group of
  radio menu items. Activating the action with a string parameter is
  equivalent to setting that parameter as the state.
  
  Radio menu items, in addition to being associated with the action, will
  have a target value. Selecting that menu item will result in activation
  of the action with the target value as the parameter. The menu item should
  be rendered as ‘selected’ when the state of the action is equal to the
  target value of the menu item.

    [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] provides a mechanism for interacting with the user.
  It can be used for authenticating mountable operations, such as loop
  mounting files, hard drive partitions or server locations. It can
  also be used to ask the user questions or show a list of applications
  preventing unmount or eject operations from completing.
  
  Note that [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] is used for more than just [gio.mount.Mount]
  objects – for example it is also used in [gio.drive.Drive.start] and
  [gio.drive.Drive.stop].
  
  Users should instantiate a subclass of this that implements all the
  various callbacks to show the required dialogs, such as
  [[gtk.mount_operation.MountOperation]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.MountOperation.html).
  If no user interaction is desired (for example when automounting
  filesystems at login time), usually `NULL` can be passed, see each method
  taking a [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] for details.
  
  Throughout the API, the term ‘TCRYPT’ is used to mean ‘compatible with TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt’.
  [TrueCrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueCrypt) is a discontinued system for
  encrypting file containers, partitions or whole disks, typically used with Windows.
  [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/) is a maintained fork of TrueCrypt with various
  improvements and auditing fixes.

    [gio.notification.Notification] is a mechanism for creating a notification to be shown
  to the user — typically as a pop-up notification presented by the
  desktop environment shell.
  
  The key difference between [gio.notification.Notification] and other similar APIs is
  that, if supported by the desktop environment, notifications sent
  with [gio.notification.Notification] will persist after the application has exited,
  and even across system reboots.
  
  Since the user may click on a notification while the application is
  not running, applications using [gio.notification.Notification] should be able to be
  started as a D-Bus service, using [gio.application.Application].
  
  In order for [gio.notification.Notification] to work, the application must have installed
  a `.desktop` file. For example:
  ```
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=Test Application
  Comment=Description of what Test Application does
  Exec=gnome-test-application
  Icon=org.gnome.TestApplication
  Terminal=false
  Type=Application
  Categories=GNOME;GTK;TestApplication Category;
  StartupNotify=true
  DBusActivatable=true
  X-GNOME-UsesNotifications=true
  ```
  
  The `X-GNOME-UsesNotifications` key indicates to GNOME Control Center
  that this application uses notifications, so it can be listed in the
  Control Center’s ‘Notifications’ panel.
  
  The `.desktop` file must be named as `org.gnome.TestApplication.desktop`,
  where `org.gnome.TestApplication` is the ID passed to
  [gio.application.Application.new_].
  
  User interaction with a notification (either the default action, or
  buttons) must be associated with actions on the application (ie:
  `app.` actions).  It is not possible to route user interaction
  through the notification itself, because the object will not exist if
  the application is autostarted as a result of a notification being
  clicked.
  
  A notification can be sent with [gio.application.Application.sendNotification].

    * reduce the rate of refresh from online sources such as calendar or

  profile GPU usage.

    A [gio.property_action.PropertyAction] is a way to get a [gio.action.Action] with a state value
  reflecting and controlling the value of a [gobject.object.ObjectG] property.
  
  The state of the action will correspond to the value of the property.
  Changing it will change the property (assuming the requested value
  matches the requirements as specified in the [gobject.param_spec.ParamSpec]).
  
  Only the most common types are presently supported.  Booleans are
  mapped to booleans, strings to strings, signed/unsigned integers to
  int32/uint32 and floats and doubles to doubles.
  
  If the property is an enum then the state will be string-typed and
  conversion will automatically be performed between the enum value and
  ‘nick’ string as per the [gobject.enum_value.EnumValue] table.
  
  Flags types are not currently supported.
  
  Properties of object types, boxed types and pointer types are not
  supported and probably never will be.
  
  Properties of [glib.variant.VariantG] types are not currently supported.
  
  If the property is boolean-valued then the action will have a `NULL`
  parameter type, and activating the action (with no parameter) will
  toggle the value of the property.
  
  In all other cases, the parameter type will correspond to the type of
  the property.
  
  The general idea here is to reduce the number of locations where a
  particular piece of state is kept (and therefore has to be synchronised
  between). [gio.property_action.PropertyAction] does not have a separate state that is kept
  in sync with the property value — its state is the property value.
  
  For example, it might be useful to create a [gio.action.Action] corresponding
  to the `visible-child-name` property of a [[gtk.stack.Stack]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Stack.html)
  so that the current page can be switched from a menu.  The active radio
  indication in the menu is then directly determined from the active page of
  the [gtk.stack.Stack].
  
  An anti-example would be binding the `active-id` property on a
  [[gtk.combo_box.ComboBox]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.ComboBox.html). This is
  because the state of the combo box itself is probably uninteresting and is
  actually being used to control something else.
  
  Another anti-example would be to bind to the `visible-child-name`
  property of a [[gtk.stack.Stack]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Stack.html) if
  this value is actually stored in [gio.settings.Settings].  In that case, the
  real source of the value is* [gio.settings.Settings].  If you want
  a [gio.action.Action] to control a setting stored in [gio.settings.Settings],
  see [gio.settings.Settings.createAction] instead, and possibly combine its
  use with [gio.settings.Settings.bind].

/**
    Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
  really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
  [[gtk.builder.Builder]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Builder.html) `.ui` files,
  splashscreen images, [gio.menu.Menu] markup XML, CSS files, icons, etc.
  These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or manually
  included as literal strings in the code.
  
  The [gio.resource.Resource] API and the
  [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) program provide a
  convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties.
  You maintain the files as normal files, so it’s easy to edit them, but during
  the build the files are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the
  executable. This means that loading the resource files are efficient (as they
  are already in memory, shared with other instances) and simple (no need to
  check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
  also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
  
  Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included
  in the resource bundle in a compressed form, but will be automatically
  uncompressed when the resource is used. This is very useful e.g. for larger
  text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
  
  Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
  `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
  The only options currently supported are:
  
   $(LIST
      * `xml-stripblanks` which will use the [`xmllint`](man:xmllint(1)) command
        to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
        the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
        the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
        the preprocessing step is skipped.
     
      * `to-pixdata` (deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32) which will use the
        `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` command to convert images to the [`GdkPixdata`](https://docs.gtk.org/gdk-pixbuf/class.Pixdata.html)
        format, which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside
        the resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the
        `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` program must be in the `PATH`, or the
        `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be set to the full path to
        the `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` executable; otherwise the resource compiler will
        abort. `to-pixdata` has been deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32, as
        [gio.resource.Resource] supports embedding modern image formats just as well. Instead
        of using it, embed a PNG or SVG file in your [gio.resource.Resource].
     
      * `json-stripblanks` which will use the
        [`json-glib-format`](man:json-glib-format(1)) command to strip ignorable
        whitespace from the JSON file. For this to work, the `JSON_GLIB_FORMAT`
        environment variable must be set to the full path to the
        `json-glib-format` executable, or it must be in the `PATH`; otherwise the
        preprocessing step is skipped. In addition, at least version 1.6 of
        `json-glib-format` is required.
   )
     
  Resource files will be exported in the [gio.resource.Resource] namespace using the
  combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
  The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
  different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
  include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
  directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
  
  Resource bundles are created by the
  [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) program
  which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that
  the XML references. These are combined into a binary resource bundle.
  
  An example resource description:
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <gresources>
    <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
      <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
      <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
      <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
      <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
    </gresource>
  </gresources>
  ```
  
  This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
  ```
  /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
  /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
  /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
  /org/gtk/Example/example.css
  ```
  
  Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use
  Java-style path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
  
  You can then use [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html) to
  compile the XML to a binary bundle that you can load with
  [gio.resource.Resource.load]. However, it’s more common to use the
  `--generate-source` and `--generate-header` arguments to create a source file
  and header to link directly into your application.
  This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
  `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
  to [`glib-compile-resources`](glib-compile-resources.html). `get_resource()`
  returns the generated [gio.resource.Resource] object. The register and unregister
  functions register the resource so its files can be accessed using
  `func@Gio.resources_lookup_data`.
  
  Once a [gio.resource.Resource] has been created and registered all the data in it can be
  accessed globally in the process by using API calls like
  `func@Gio.resources_open_stream` to stream the data or
  `func@Gio.resources_lookup_data` to get a direct pointer to the data. You can
  also use URIs like `resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png` with
  [gio.file.File] to access the resource data.
  
  Some higher-level APIs, such as [[gtk.application.Application]](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/class.Application.html),
  will automatically load resources from certain well-known paths in the
  resource namespace as a convenience. See the documentation for those APIs
  for details.
  
  There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the
  compiler support for constructor and destructor functions (where available)
  to automatically create and register the [gio.resource.Resource] on startup or library
  load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to
  register/unregister the resource are created instead. This requires an
  explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all
  platforms, even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported.
  (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
  
  Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a
  library, so if you are unloading libraries during runtime you need to be very
  careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes
  away when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally
  a problem, since most resource accesses are for your own resources, and
  resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
  
  # Overlays
  
  When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is
  often useful to be able to replace resources in the program or library,
  without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing purposes.
  Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment
  variable to selectively overlay resources with replacements from the
  filesystem.  It is a `G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR`-separated list of substitutions
  to perform during resource lookups. It is ignored when running in a setuid
  process.
  
  A substitution has the form
  
  ```
  /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
  ```
  
  The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay
  applies.  The part after is a filesystem path which contains files and
  subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
  equivalent names.
  
  In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the
  resource path `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then [gio.resource.Resource] would check
  the filesystem path `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was
  found there, it would be used instead.  This is an overlay, not an outright
  replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the
  built-in version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently
  supported.
  
  Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash
  before the `=`.  The path after the slash should ideally be absolute, but
  this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the location of a
  single resource with an individual file.

/**
    The [gio.settings.Settings] class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
  application settings.
  
  Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
  settings with [gio.settings.Settings] is typically extremely fast: on
  approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
  [glib.hash_table.HashTable] lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in
  terms of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
  for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
  (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
  case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
  a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn’t
  even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
  only ever modify [gio.settings.Settings] keys in response to explicit user action.
  Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
  made during startup — for example, when setting the initial value
  of preferences widgets.  The built-in [gio.settings.Settings.bind]
  functionality is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals
  as a result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
  
  When creating a [gio.settings.Settings] instance, you have to specify a schema
  that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
  values, as well as some other information.
  
  Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
  are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
  can also be ‘[relocatable](#relocatable-schemas)’, i.e. not equipped with
  a fixed path. This is
  useful e.g. when the schema describes an ‘account’, and you want to be
  able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
  
  Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character (`/`)
  and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
  be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
  library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
  `/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/` and `/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/`.
  Paths should not start with `/apps/`, `/desktop/` or `/system/` as
  they often did in GConf.
  
  Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
  restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
  values as [glib.variant.VariantG], and allows any [glib.variant_type.VariantType] for
  keys. Key names are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and `-`.
  Furthermore, the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
  with a `-`, and must not contain consecutive dashes.
  
  Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
  localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
  and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
  `gettext-domain` attribute of the `<schemalist>` or `<schema>`
  elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
  the `<default>` element. The string which is translated includes all text in
  the `<default>` element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
  
  The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
  [locale category for
  translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
  The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
  translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
  XML comment immediately above the `<default>` element — it is recommended to
  add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
  implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
  attribute can be set on the `<default>` element to disambiguate multiple
  defaults which use the same string.
  
  For example:
  ```xml
   <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
        GVariant serialization syntax.
        See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
   <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
  ```
  
  Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
  [glib.variant.VariantG]s (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or
  runtime errors will occur.
  
  GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
  by the [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html)
  utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
  
  A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
  [gschema.dtd](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd)
  
  The [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html) tool expects schema
  files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
  
  At runtime, schemas are identified by their ID (as specified in the
  `id` attribute of the `<schema>` element). The convention for schema
  IDs is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
  e.g. `org.gnome.SessionManager`. In particular, if the settings are
  for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
  and schema ID should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
  associated with one named application, the ID should not use
  StudlyCaps, e.g. `org.gnome.font-rendering`.
  
  In addition to [glib.variant.VariantG] types, keys can have types that have
  enumerated types. These can be described by a `<choice>`,
  `<enum>` or `<flags>` element, as seen in the
  second example below. The underlying type of such a key
  is string, but you can use [gio.settings.Settings.getEnum],
  [gio.settings.Settings.setEnum], [gio.settings.Settings.getFlags],
  [gio.settings.Settings.setFlags] access the numeric values corresponding to
  the string value of enum and flags keys.
  
  An example for default value:
  ```xml
  <schemalist>
    <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
  
      <key name="greeting" type="s">
        <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
        <summary>A greeting</summary>
        <description>
          Greeting of the invading martians
        </description>
      </key>
  
      <key name="box" type="(ii)">
        <default>(20,30)</default>
      </key>
  
      <key name="empty-string" type="s">
        <default>""</default>
        <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
      </key>
  
    </schema>
  </schemalist>
  ```

  ## Vendor overrides
  
  Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
  an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
  to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
  is inconvenient and error-prone,
  [`glib-compile-schemas`](glib-compile-schemas.html) reads so-called ‘vendor
  override’ files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
  schema sources which can override default values. The schema ID serves
  as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
  serialized [glib.variant.VariantG] form, as in the following example:
  ```
  [org.gtk.Example]
  key1='string'
  key2=1.5
  ```
  
  `glib-compile-schemas` expects schema files to have the extension
  `.gschema.override`.
  
  ## Binding
  
  A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind [gobject.object.ObjectG]
  properties directly to settings, using [gio.settings.Settings.bind]. Once a
  [gobject.object.ObjectG] property has been bound to a setting, changes on
  either side are automatically propagated to the other side. GSettings handles
  details like mapping between [gobject.object.ObjectG] and [glib.variant.VariantG]
  types, and preventing infinite cycles.
  
  This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
  underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
  looks for a boolean property with the name `sensitivity` and
  automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
  If this ‘magic’ gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
  [gio.types.SettingsBindFlags.NoSensitivity] flag.
  
  ## Relocatable schemas
  
  A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
  `<schema>` element. By using [gio.settings.Settings.newWithPath], a [gio.settings.Settings]
  object can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
  instance. Paths passed to [gio.settings.Settings.newWithPath] will typically be
  constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
  identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
  be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
  dependency library.
  
  For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
  for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
  `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
  `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
  `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
  they can be specified as `<child>` elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
  ```xml
  <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
    <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
  </schema>
  ```
  
  ## Build system integration
  
  GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
  installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
  following to your `configure.ac`:
  ```
  GLIB_GSETTINGS
  ```
  
  In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
  install the named schema:
  ```
  gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
  EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
  
  @GSETTINGS_RULES@
  ```
  
  No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
  translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
  be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
  0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
  ```
  data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
  ```
  
  Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
  ```
  [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
  ```
  
  GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the `<summary>` and
  `<description>` elements, and also any `<default>` elements which have a
  `l10n` attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml`
  file by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
  `.gschema.xml.in` template.
  
  If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
  schema, it can either be defined manually using an `<enum>` element in the
  schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
  approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
  synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
  ```
  gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
  gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
  ```
  
  `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
  which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
  `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
  automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
  rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
  `EXTRA_DIST`.

/**
    The [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] interface defines a generic interface for
  non-strictly-typed data that is stored in a hierarchy. To implement
  an alternative storage backend for [gio.settings.Settings], you need to
  implement the [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] interface and then make it implement the
  extension point `G_SETTINGS_BACKEND_EXTENSION_POINT_NAME`.
  
  The interface defines methods for reading and writing values, a
  method for determining if writing of certain values will fail
  (lockdown) and a change notification mechanism.
  
  The semantics of the interface are very precisely defined and
  implementations must carefully adhere to the expectations of
  callers that are documented on each of the interface methods.
  
  Some of the [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] functions accept or return a
  [glib.tree.Tree]. These trees always have strings as keys and
  [glib.variant.VariantG] as values.
  
  The [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] API is exported to allow third-party
  implementations, but does not carry the same stability guarantees
  as the public GIO API. For this reason, you have to define the

/**
    The [gio.settings_schema_source.SettingsSchemaSource] and [gio.settings_schema.SettingsSchema] APIs provide a
  mechanism for advanced control over the loading of schemas and a
  mechanism for introspecting their content.
  
  Plugin loading systems that wish to provide plugins a way to access
  settings face the problem of how to make the schemas for these
  settings visible to GSettings.  Typically, a plugin will want to ship
  the schema along with itself and it won't be installed into the
  standard system directories for schemas.
  
  [gio.settings_schema_source.SettingsSchemaSource] provides a mechanism for dealing with this
  by allowing the creation of a new ‘schema source’ from which schemas can
  be acquired.  This schema source can then become part of the metadata
  associated with the plugin and queried whenever the plugin requires
  access to some settings.
  
  Consider the following example:
  
  ```c
  typedef struct
  {
     …
     GSettingsSchemaSource *schema_source;
     …
  } Plugin;
  
  Plugin *
  initialise_plugin (const gchar *dir)
  {
    Plugin *plugin;
  
    …
  
    plugin->schema_source =
      g_settings_schema_source_new_from_directory (dir,
        g_settings_schema_source_get_default (), FALSE, NULL);
  
    …
  
    return plugin;
  }
  
  …
  
  GSettings *
  plugin_get_settings (Plugin      *plugin,
                       const gchar *schema_id)
  {
    GSettingsSchema *schema;
  
    if (schema_id == NULL)
      schema_id = plugin->identifier;
  
    schema = g_settings_schema_source_lookup (plugin->schema_source,
                                              schema_id, FALSE);
  
    if (schema == NULL)
      {
        … disable the plugin or abort, etc …
      }
  
    return g_settings_new_full (schema, NULL, NULL);
  }
  ```
  
  The code above shows how hooks should be added to the code that
  initialises (or enables) the plugin to create the schema source and
  how an API can be added to the plugin system to provide a convenient
  way for the plugin to access its settings, using the schemas that it
  ships.
  
  From the standpoint of the plugin, it would need to ensure that it
  ships a gschemas.compiled file as part of itself, and then simply do
  the following:
  
  ```c
  {
    GSettings *settings;
    gint some_value;
  
    settings = plugin_get_settings (self, NULL);
    some_value = g_settings_get_int (settings, "some-value");
    …
  }
  ```
  
  It's also possible that the plugin system expects the schema source
  files (ie: `.gschema.xml` files) instead of a `gschemas.compiled` file.
  In that case, the plugin loading system must compile the schemas for
  itself before attempting to create the settings source.

    As of GLib 2.46, [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] is deprecated in favor of
  [gio.task.Task], which provides a simpler API.
  
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] implements [gio.async_result.AsyncResult].
  
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] handles [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback]s, error
  reporting, operation cancellation and the final state of an operation,
  completely transparent to the application. Results can be returned
  as a pointer e.g. for functions that return data that is collected
  asynchronously, a boolean value for checking the success or failure
  of an operation, or a `gssize` for operations which return the number
  of bytes modified by the operation; all of the simple return cases
  are covered.
  
  Most of the time, an application will not need to know of the details
  of this API; it is handled transparently, and any necessary operations
  are handled by [gio.async_result.AsyncResult]’s interface. However, if implementing
  a new GIO module, for writing language bindings, or for complex
  applications that need better control of how asynchronous operations
  are completed, it is important to understand this functionality.
  
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult]s are tagged with the calling function to ensure
  that asynchronous functions and their finishing functions are used
  together correctly.
  
  To create a new [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult], call [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.new_].
  If the result needs to be created for a [glib.error.ErrorG], use
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.newFromError] or
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.newTakeError]. If a [glib.error.ErrorG] is not available
  (e.g. the asynchronous operation doesn’t take a [glib.error.ErrorG] argument),
  but the result still needs to be created for an error condition, use
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.newError] (or
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setErrorVa] if your application or binding
  requires passing a variable argument list directly), and the error can then
  be propagated through the use of
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.propagateError].
  
  An asynchronous operation can be made to ignore a cancellation event by
  calling [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setHandleCancellation] with a
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] for the operation and `FALSE`. This is useful for
  operations that are dangerous to cancel, such as close (which would
  cause a leak if cancelled before being run).
  
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] can integrate into GLib’s event loop,
  [glib.main_loop.MainLoop], or it can use [glib.thread.Thread]s.
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.complete] will finish an I/O task directly
  from the point where it is called.
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.completeInIdle] will finish it from an idle
  handler in the  thread-default main context (see
  [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) where the [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult]
  was created. [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.runInThread] will run the job in
  a separate thread and then use
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.completeInIdle] to deliver the result.
  
  To set the results of an asynchronous function,
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setOpResGpointer],
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setOpResGboolean], and
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setOpResGssize]
  are provided, setting the operation's result to a [xlib.types.void*], [glib.types.SOURCE_REMOVE], or
  `gssize`, respectively.
  
  Likewise, to get the result of an asynchronous function,
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.getOpResGpointer],
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.getOpResGboolean], and
  [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.getOpResGssize] are
  provided, getting the operation’s result as a [xlib.types.void*], [glib.types.SOURCE_REMOVE], and
  `gssize`, respectively.
  
  For the details of the requirements implementations must respect, see
  [gio.async_result.AsyncResult].  A typical implementation of an asynchronous
  operation using [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] looks something like this:
  
  ```c
  static void
  baked_cb (Cake    *cake,
            gpointer user_data)
  {
    // In this example, this callback is not given a reference to the cake,
    // so the GSimpleAsyncResult has to take a reference to it.
    GSimpleAsyncResult *result = user_data;
  
    if (cake == NULL)

    // In this example, we assume that baked_cb is called as a callback from
    // the mainloop, so it's safe to complete the operation synchronously here.
    // If, however, _baker_prepare_cake () might call its callback without
    // first returning to the mainloop — inadvisable, but some APIs do so —
    // we would need to use g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle().
    g_simple_async_result_complete (result);
    g_object_unref (result);

/**
    A [gio.socket.Socket] is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
  direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
  It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
  
  [gio.socket.Socket] is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
  network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
  use it directly, but rather through classes like [gio.socket_client.SocketClient],
  [gio.socket_service.SocketService] and [gio.socket_connection.SocketConnection]. However there may
  be cases where direct use of [gio.socket.Socket] is useful.
  
  [gio.socket.Socket] implements the [gio.initable.Initable] interface, so if it is manually
  constructed by e.g. [gobject.object.ObjectG.new_] you must call
  [gio.initable.Initable.init_] and check the results before using the object.
  This is done automatically in [gio.socket.Socket.new_] and
  [gio.socket.Socket.newFromFd], so these functions can return `NULL`.
  
  Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
  in blocking mode all operations (which don’t take an explicit blocking
  parameter) block until the requested operation
  is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
  would block return immediately with a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error.
  To know when a call would successfully run you can call
  [gio.socket.Socket.conditionCheck], or [gio.socket.Socket.conditionWait].
  You can also use [gio.socket.Socket.createSource] and attach it to a
  [glib.main_context.MainContext] to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
  Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
  blocking mode is emulated in [gio.socket.Socket].
  
  When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
  handle getting a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error even when some other
  function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
  of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
  reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
  until a write returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
  
  [gio.socket.Socket]s can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
  For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
  either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
  address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
  specified or received in each I/O operation.
  
  All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
  
  Note that creating a [gio.socket.Socket] causes the signal `SIGPIPE` to be
  ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
  command-line utility that uses [gio.socket.Socket], you may need to take into
  account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
  if it tries to write to `stdout` after it has been closed.
  
  Like most other APIs in GLib, [gio.socket.Socket] is not inherently thread safe. To use
  a [gio.socket.Socket] concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
  locking.
  
  ## Nagle’s algorithm
  
  Since GLib 2.80, [gio.socket.Socket] will automatically set the `TCP_NODELAY` option on
  all [gio.types.SocketType.Stream] sockets. This disables
  [Nagle’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle`27s_algorithm`) as it
  typically does more harm than good on modern networks.
  
  If your application needs Nagle’s algorithm enabled, call
  [gio.socket.Socket.setOption] after constructing a [gio.socket.Socket] to enable it:
  ```c
  socket = g_socket_new (…, G_SOCKET_TYPE_STREAM, …);
  if (socket != NULL)
    {
      g_socket_set_option (socket, IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, FALSE, &local_error);
      // handle error if needed
    }
  ```

    [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] allows the creation of and interaction with child
  processes.
  
  Processes can be communicated with using standard GIO-style APIs (ie:
  [gio.input_stream.InputStream], [gio.output_stream.OutputStream]). There are GIO-style APIs
  to wait for process termination (ie: cancellable and with an asynchronous
  variant).
  
  There is an API to force a process to terminate, as well as a
  race-free API for sending UNIX signals to a subprocess.
  
  One major advantage that GIO brings over the core GLib library is
  comprehensive API for asynchronous I/O, such
  [gio.output_stream.OutputStream.spliceAsync].  This makes [gio.subprocess.Subprocess]
  significantly more powerful and flexible than equivalent APIs in
  some other languages such as the `subprocess.py`
  included with Python.  For example, using [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] one could
  create two child processes, reading standard output from the first,
  processing it, and writing to the input stream of the second, all
  without blocking the main loop.
  
  A powerful [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.communicate] API is provided similar to the
  `communicate()` method of `subprocess.py`. This enables very easy
  interaction with a subprocess that has been opened with pipes.
  
  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] defaults to tight control over the file descriptors open
  in the child process, avoiding dangling-FD issues that are caused by
  a simple `fork()`/`exec()`.  The only open file descriptors in the
  spawned process are ones that were explicitly specified by the
  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] API (unless [gio.types.SubprocessFlags.InheritFds] was
  specified).
  
  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] will quickly reap all child processes as they exit,
  avoiding ‘zombie processes’ remaining around for long periods of
  time.  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.wait] can be used to wait for this to happen,
  but it will happen even without the call being explicitly made.
  
  As a matter of principle, [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] has no API that accepts
  shell-style space-separated strings.  It will, however, match the
  typical shell behaviour of searching the `PATH` for executables that do
  not contain a directory separator in their name. By default, the `PATH`
  of the current process is used.  You can specify
  [gio.types.SubprocessFlags.SearchPathFromEnvp] to use the `PATH` of the
  launcher environment instead.
  
  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] attempts to have a very simple API for most uses (ie:
  spawning a subprocess with arguments and support for most typical
  kinds of input and output redirection).  See [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.new_]. The
  [gio.subprocess_launcher.SubprocessLauncher] API is provided for more complicated cases
  (advanced types of redirection, environment variable manipulation,
  change of working directory, child setup functions, etc).
  
  A typical use of [gio.subprocess.Subprocess] will involve calling
  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.new_], followed by [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.waitAsync] or
  [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.wait].  After the process exits, the status can be
  checked using functions such as [gio.subprocess.Subprocess.getIfExited] (which
  are similar to the familiar `WIFEXITED`-style POSIX macros).

    A [gio.task.Task] represents and manages a cancellable ‘task’.
  
  ## Asynchronous operations
  
  The most common usage of [gio.task.Task] is as a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult], to
  manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
  [gio.task.Task.new_] in the ‘start’ method, followed by
  [gio.task.Task.setTaskData] and the like if you need to keep some
  additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
  task object around through your asynchronous operation.
  Eventually, you will call a method such as
  [gio.task.Task.returnPointer] or [gio.task.Task.returnError], which
  will save the value you give it and then invoke the task’s callback
  function in the thread-default main context (see
  [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault])
  where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
  loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the [gio.task.Task] back to
  the operation’s finish function (as a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult]), and you can
  use [gio.task.Task.propagatePointer] or the like to extract the
  return value.
  
  Using [gio.task.Task] requires the thread-default [glib.main_context.MainContext] from when
  the [gio.task.Task] was constructed to be running at least until the task has
  completed and its data has been freed.
  
  If a [gio.task.Task] has been constructed and its callback set, it is an error to
  not call `g_task_return_*()` on it. GLib will warn at runtime if this happens
  (since 2.76).
  
  Here is an example for using [gio.task.Task] as a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult]:
  ```c
  typedef struct {
    CakeFrostingType frosting;
    char *message;
  } DecorationData;
  
  static void
  decoration_data_free (DecorationData *decoration)
  {
    g_free (decoration->message);
    g_slice_free (DecorationData, decoration);
  }
  
  static void
  baked_cb (Cake     *cake,
            gpointer  user_data)
  {
    GTask *task = user_data;
    DecorationData *decoration = g_task_get_task_data (task);
    GError *error = NULL;
  
    if (cake == NULL)
      {
        g_task_return_new_error (task, BAKER_ERROR, BAKER_ERROR_NO_FLOUR,
                                 "Go to the supermarket");
        g_object_unref (task);
        return;
      }
  
    if (!cake_decorate (cake, decoration->frosting, decoration->message, &error))
      {
        g_object_unref (cake);
        // g_task_return_error() takes ownership of error
        g_task_return_error (task, error);
        g_object_unref (task);
        return;
      }
  
    g_task_return_pointer (task, cake, g_object_unref);
    g_object_unref (task);
  }

                         CakeFlavor           flavor,
                         CakeFrostingType     frosting,

  ## Chained asynchronous operations
  
  [gio.task.Task] also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that
  internally chain together several smaller asynchronous
  operations. [gio.task.Task.getCancellable], [gio.task.Task.getContext],
  and [gio.task.Task.getPriority] allow you to get back the task’s
  [gio.cancellable.Cancellable], [glib.main_context.MainContext], and
  [I/O priority](iface.AsyncResult.html#io-priority)
  when starting a new subtask, so you don’t have to keep track
  of them yourself. [gio.task.Task.attachSource] simplifies the case
  of waiting for a source to fire (automatically using the correct
  [glib.main_context.MainContext] and priority).
  
  Here is an example for chained asynchronous operations:
  ```c
  typedef struct {
    Cake *cake;
    CakeFrostingType frosting;
    char *message;
  } BakingData;
  
  static void
  decoration_data_free (BakingData *bd)
  {
    if (bd->cake)
      g_object_unref (bd->cake);
    g_free (bd->message);
    g_slice_free (BakingData, bd);
  }
  
  static void
  decorated_cb (Cake         *cake,
                GAsyncResult *result,
                gpointer      user_data)
  {
    GTask *task = user_data;
    GError *error = NULL;
  
    if (!cake_decorate_finish (cake, result, &error))
      {
        g_object_unref (cake);
        g_task_return_error (task, error);
        g_object_unref (task);
        return;
      }
  
    // baking_data_free() will drop its ref on the cake, so we have to
    // take another here to give to the caller.
    g_task_return_pointer (task, g_object_ref (cake), g_object_unref);
    g_object_unref (task);
  }
  
  static gboolean
  decorator_ready (gpointer user_data)
  {
    GTask *task = user_data;
    BakingData *bd = g_task_get_task_data (task);
  
    cake_decorate_async (bd->cake, bd->frosting, bd->message,
                         g_task_get_cancellable (task),
                         decorated_cb, task);
  
    return G_SOURCE_REMOVE;
  }
  
  static void
  baked_cb (Cake     *cake,
            gpointer  user_data)
  {
    GTask *task = user_data;
    BakingData *bd = g_task_get_task_data (task);
    GError *error = NULL;
  
    if (cake == NULL)
      {
        g_task_return_new_error (task, BAKER_ERROR, BAKER_ERROR_NO_FLOUR,
                                 "Go to the supermarket");
        g_object_unref (task);
        return;
      }
  
    bd->cake = cake;
  
    // Bail out now if the user has already cancelled
    if (g_task_return_error_if_cancelled (task))
      {
        g_object_unref (task);
        return;
      }
  
    if (cake_decorator_available (cake))
      decorator_ready (task);
    else
      {
        GSource *source;
  
        source = cake_decorator_wait_source_new (cake);
        // Attach @source to @task’s GMainContext and have it call
        // decorator_ready() when it is ready.

        g_source_unref (source);
      }
  }

    return g_task_propagate_pointer (G_TASK (result), error);
  }
  ```
  
  ## Asynchronous operations from synchronous ones
  
  You can use [gio.task.Task.runInThread] to turn a synchronous
  operation into an asynchronous one, by running it in a thread.
  When it completes, the result will be dispatched to the thread-default main
  context (see [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) where the [gio.task.Task]
  was created.
  
  Running a task in a thread:
  ```c
  typedef struct {
    guint radius;
    CakeFlavor flavor;
    CakeFrostingType frosting;
    char *message;
  } CakeData;
  
  static void
  cake_data_free (CakeData *cake_data)
  {
    g_free (cake_data->message);
    g_slice_free (CakeData, cake_data);
  }
  
  static void
  bake_cake_thread (GTask         *task,
                    gpointer       source_object,
                    gpointer       task_data,
                    GCancellable  *cancellable)
  {
    Baker *self = source_object;
    CakeData *cake_data = task_data;
    Cake *cake;
    GError *error = NULL;
  
    cake = bake_cake (baker, cake_data->radius, cake_data->flavor,
                      cake_data->frosting, cake_data->message,
                      cancellable, &error);
    if (cake)
      g_task_return_pointer (task, cake, g_object_unref);
    else
      g_task_return_error (task, error);
  }
  
  void
  baker_bake_cake_async (Baker               *self,
                         guint                radius,
                         CakeFlavor           flavor,
                         CakeFrostingType     frosting,
                         const char          *message,
                         GCancellable        *cancellable,
                         GAsyncReadyCallback  callback,
                         gpointer             user_data)
  {
    CakeData *cake_data;
    GTask *task;
  
    cake_data = g_slice_new (CakeData);
    cake_data->radius = radius;
    cake_data->flavor = flavor;
    cake_data->frosting = frosting;
    cake_data->message = g_strdup (message);
    task = g_task_new (self, cancellable, callback, user_data);
    g_task_set_task_data (task, cake_data, (GDestroyNotify) cake_data_free);
    g_task_run_in_thread (task, bake_cake_thread);
    g_object_unref (task);
  }
  
  Cake *
  baker_bake_cake_finish (Baker         *self,
                          GAsyncResult  *result,
                          GError       **error)
  {
    g_return_val_if_fail (g_task_is_valid (result, self), NULL);
  
    return g_task_propagate_pointer (G_TASK (result), error);
  }
  ```
  
  ## Adding cancellability to uncancellable tasks
  
  Finally, [gio.task.Task.runInThread] and
  [gio.task.Task.runInThreadSync] can be used to turn an uncancellable
  operation into a cancellable one. If you call
  [gio.task.Task.setReturnOnCancel], passing `TRUE`, then if the task’s
  [gio.cancellable.Cancellable] is cancelled, it will return control back to the
  caller immediately, while allowing the task thread to continue running in the
  background (and simply discarding its result when it finally does finish).
  Provided that the task thread is careful about how it uses
  locks and other externally-visible resources, this allows you
  to make ‘GLib-friendly’ asynchronous and cancellable
  synchronous variants of blocking APIs.
  
  Cancelling a task:
  ```c
  static void
  bake_cake_thread (GTask         *task,
                    gpointer       source_object,
                    gpointer       task_data,
                    GCancellable  *cancellable)
  {
    Baker *self = source_object;
    CakeData *cake_data = task_data;
    Cake *cake;
    GError *error = NULL;
  
    cake = bake_cake (baker, cake_data->radius, cake_data->flavor,
                      cake_data->frosting, cake_data->message,
                      &error);
    if (error)
      {
        g_task_return_error (task, error);
        return;
      }
  
    // If the task has already been cancelled, then we don’t want to add
    // the cake to the cake cache. Likewise, we don’t  want to have the
    // task get cancelled in the middle of updating the cache.
    // g_task_set_return_on_cancel() will return %TRUE here if it managed
    // to disable return-on-cancel, or %FALSE if the task was cancelled
    // before it could.
    if (g_task_set_return_on_cancel (task, FALSE))
      {
        // If the caller cancels at this point, their
        // GAsyncReadyCallback won’t be invoked until we return,
        // so we don’t have to worry that this code will run at
        // the same time as that code does. But if there were
        // other functions that might look at the cake cache,
        // then we’d probably need a GMutex here as well.
        baker_add_cake_to_cache (baker, cake);
        g_task_return_pointer (task, cake, g_object_unref);
      }
  }

  ## Porting from [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult]
  
  [gio.task.Task]’s API attempts to be simpler than [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult]’s
  in several ways:
  
  $(LIST
    * You can save task-specific data with [gio.task.Task.setTaskData], and
      retrieve it later with [gio.task.Task.getTaskData]. This replaces the
      abuse of [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setOpResGpointer] for the same
      purpose with [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult].
    * In addition to the task data, [gio.task.Task] also keeps track of the
      [priority](iface.AsyncResult.html#io-priority), [gio.cancellable.Cancellable],
      and [glib.main_context.MainContext] associated with the task, so tasks that
      consist of a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
      to those values when starting each sub-task.
    * [gio.task.Task.returnErrorIfCancelled] provides simplified
      handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
      overrides any other [gio.task.Task] return value by default, like
      [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] does when
      [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.setCheckCancellable] is called.
      (You can use [gio.task.Task.setCheckCancellable] to turn off that
      behavior.) On the other hand, [gio.task.Task.runInThread]
      guarantees that it will always run your
      `task_func`, even if the task’s [gio.cancellable.Cancellable]
      is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
      you can start your `task_func` with a
      [gio.task.Task.returnErrorIfCancelled] check if you need the
      old behavior.
    * The ‘return’ methods (eg, [gio.task.Task.returnPointer])
      automatically cause the task to be ‘completed’ as well, and
      there is no need to worry about the ‘complete’ vs ‘complete in idle’
      distinction. ([gio.task.Task] automatically figures out
      whether the task’s callback can be invoked directly, or
      if it needs to be sent to another [glib.main_context.MainContext], or delayed
      until the next iteration of the current [glib.main_context.MainContext].)
    * The ‘finish’ functions for [gio.task.Task] based operations are generally
      much simpler than [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] ones, normally consisting
      of only a single call to [gio.task.Task.propagatePointer] or the like.
      Since [gio.task.Task.propagatePointer] ‘steals’ the return value from
      the [gio.task.Task], it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
      prevent it from being freed twice.
    * With [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult], it was common to call
      [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult.propagateError] from the
      `_finish()` wrapper function, and have
      virtual method implementations only deal with successful
      returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
      difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class’s async
      methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
      simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
      appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
      Note that wrapper methods can now use
      [gio.async_result.AsyncResult.legacyPropagateError] to do old-style
      [gio.simple_async_result.SimpleAsyncResult] error-returning behavior, and
      [gio.async_result.AsyncResult.isTagged] to check if a result is tagged as
      having come from the `_async()` wrapper
      function (for ‘short-circuit’ results, such as when passing
      `0` to [gio.input_stream.InputStream.readAsync]).
  )
    
  ## Thread-safety considerations
  
  Due to some infelicities in the API design, there is a
  thread-safety concern that users of [gio.task.Task] have to be aware of:
  
  If the `main` thread drops its last reference to the source object
  or the task data before the task is finalized, then the finalizers
  of these objects may be called on the worker thread.
  
  This is a problem if the finalizers use non-threadsafe API, and
  can lead to hard-to-debug crashes. Possible workarounds include:
  
  $(LIST
    * Clear task data in a signal handler for `notify::completed`
    * Keep iterating a main context in the main thread and defer
      dropping the reference to the source object to that main
      context when the task is finalized
  )

/**
    A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user’s
  session bus.
  
  Note that [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] modifies the user’s environment, calling
  [`setenv()`](man:setenv(3)). This is not thread-safe, so all [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus]
  calls should be completed before threads are spawned, or should have
  appropriate locking to ensure no access conflicts to environment variables
  shared between [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] and other threads.
  
  ## Creating unit tests using [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus]
  
  Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
  D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
  usually don’t activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
  target system. The [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] object makes this easier for us by taking care
  of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
  up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
  code tree.
  
  The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
  D-Bus daemon. Typically a `services` subdirectory of your `tests` directory
  is a good place to put this file.
  
  The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
  uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
  achieve this by adding a file such as `my-server.service.in` in the services
  directory and have it processed by configure.
  
  ```
  [D-BUS Service]
  Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
  Exec=@abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
  ```
  
  You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
  fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
  test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
  preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
  
  ```
  -DTEST_SERVICES=\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\"
  ```
  
  Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
  you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] scaffolding.
  
  An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
  here:
  [gdbus-test-fixture.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
  
  Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
  service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
  some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
  service uses [gio.settings.Settings] and installs a schema then it is important
  that your test service not load the schema in the ordinary installed location
  (chances are that your service and schema files are not yet installed, or
  worse; there is an older version of the schema file sitting in the install
  location).
  
  Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
  environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
  created by [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] and then in turn inherited by any services the
  D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
  a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
  rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
  `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the in tree directory holding your schemas
  in the above `fixture_setup()` routine.
  
  The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This
  can be achieved by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running
  test cases, an autotools setup might do the following in the directory
  holding schemas:
  
  ```
      all-am:
              $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
  
      CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled
  ```

    Support for UNIX-domain (also known as local) sockets, corresponding to

  UNIX domain sockets are generally visible in the filesystem.
  However, some systems support abstract socket names which are not

  permissions, visibility, etc. Currently this is only supported
  under Linux. If you attempt to use abstract sockets on other

/**
    The [gio.volume.Volume] interface represents user-visible objects that can be
  mounted. Note, when [porting from GnomeVFS](migrating-gnome-vfs.html),
  [gio.volume.Volume] is the moral equivalent of `GnomeVFSDrive`.
  
  Mounting a [gio.volume.Volume] instance is an asynchronous operation. For more
  information about asynchronous operations, see [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] and
  [gio.task.Task]. To mount a [gio.volume.Volume], first call [gio.volume.Volume.mount]
  with (at least) the [gio.volume.Volume] instance, optionally a
  [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] object and a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback].
  
  Typically, one will only want to pass `NULL` for the
  [gio.mount_operation.MountOperation] if automounting all volumes when a desktop session
  starts since it’s not desirable to put up a lot of dialogs asking
  for credentials.
  
  The callback will be fired when the operation has resolved (either
  with success or failure), and a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] instance will be
  passed to the callback.  That callback should then call
  [gio.volume.Volume.mountFinish] with the [gio.volume.Volume] instance and the
  [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] data to see if the operation was completed
  successfully.  If a [glib.error.ErrorG] is present when
  [gio.volume.Volume.mountFinish] is called, then it will be filled with any
  error information.
  
  ## Volume Identifiers
  
  It is sometimes necessary to directly access the underlying
  operating system object behind a volume (e.g. for passing a volume
  to an application via the command line). For this purpose, GIO
  allows to obtain an ‘identifier’ for the volume. There can be
  different kinds of identifiers, such as Hal UDIs, filesystem labels,
  traditional Unix devices (e.g. `/dev/sda2`), UUIDs. GIO uses predefined
  strings as names for the different kinds of identifiers:
  `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UUID`, `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_LABEL`, etc.
  Use [gio.volume.Volume.getIdentifier] to obtain an identifier for a volume.
  
  Note that `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_HAL_UDI` will only be available
  when the GVFS hal volume monitor is in use. Other volume monitors
  will generally be able to provide the `G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UNIX_DEVICE`
  identifier, which can be used to obtain a hal device by means of
  `libhal_manager_find_device_string_match()`.
