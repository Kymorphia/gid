    [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream] is implemented by [gio.input_stream.InputStream]s that
  can be polled for readiness to read. This can be used when
  interfacing with a non-GIO API that expects
  UNIX-file-descriptor-style asynchronous I/O rather than GIO-style.
  
  Some classes may implement [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream] but have only certain
  instances of that class be pollable. If [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream.canPoll]
  returns false, then the behavior of other [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream] methods is

    after this returns true would still block. To guarantee
    non-blocking behavior, you should always use
    [gio.pollable_input_stream.PollableInputStream.readNonblocking], which will return a
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error rather than blocking.

        has occurred on stream, this will result in

    Note that since this method never blocks, you cannot actually
