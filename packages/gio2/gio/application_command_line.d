/**
    [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] represents a command-line invocation of
    an application.
    
    It is created by [gio.application.Application] and emitted
    in the `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` signal and virtual function.
    
    The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
    with. It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
    local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
    invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
    commandline to this process).
    
    The [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] object can provide the @argc and @argv
    parameters for use with the [glib.option_context.OptionContext] command-line parsing API,
    with the [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getArguments] function. See
    [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
    for an example.
    
    The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
    messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.
    
    For remote invocation, the originally-invoked process exits when
    [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.done] method is called. This method is
    also automatically called when the object is disposed.
    
    The main use for [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] (and the
    `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
    You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
    your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
    have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
    in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
    aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
    does not return until the editing is done.
    
    Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
    `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` handler. The launching instance exits
    once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
    the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
    of the launching instance.
    
    ```c
    static int
    command_line (GApplication            *application,
                  GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
    {
      gchar **argv;
      gint argc;
      gint i;
    
      argv = g_application_command_line_get_arguments (cmdline, &argc);
    
      g_application_command_line_print (cmdline,
                                        "This text is written back\n"
                                        "to stdout of the caller\n");
    
      for (i = 0; i < argc; i++)
        g_print ("argument %d: %s\n", i, argv[i]);
    
      g_strfreev (argv);
    
      return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    The complete example can be found here:
    [gapplication-example-cmdline.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline.c)
    
    In more complicated cases, the handling of the commandline can be
    split between the launcher and the primary instance.
    
    ```c
    static gboolean
     test_local_cmdline (GApplication   *application,
                         gchar        ***arguments,
                         gint           *exit_status)
    {
      gint i, j;
      gchar **argv;
    
      argv = *arguments;
    
      if (argv[0] == NULL)
        {
          *exit_status = 0;
          return FALSE;
        }
    
      i = 1;
      while (argv[i])
        {
          if (g_str_has_prefix (argv[i], "--local-"))
            {
              g_print ("handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
              g_free (argv[i]);
              for (j = i; argv[j]; j++)
                argv[j] = argv[j + 1];
            }
          else
            {
              g_print ("not handling argument %s locally\n", argv[i]);
              i++;
            }
        }
    
      *exit_status = 0;
    
      return FALSE;
    }
    
    static void
    test_application_class_init (TestApplicationClass *class)
    {
      G_APPLICATION_CLASS (class)->local_command_line = test_local_cmdline;
    
      ...
    }
    ```
    
    In this example of split commandline handling, options that start
    with `--local-` are handled locally, all other options are passed
    to the `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` handler which runs in the primary
    instance.
    
    The complete example can be found here:
    [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c)
    
    If handling the commandline requires a lot of work, it may be better to defer it.
    
    ```c
    static gboolean
    my_cmdline_handler (gpointer data)
    {
      GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline = data;
    
      // do the heavy lifting in an idle
    
      g_application_command_line_set_exit_status (cmdline, 0);
      g_object_unref (cmdline); // this releases the application
    
      return G_SOURCE_REMOVE;
    }
    
    static int
    command_line (GApplication            *application,
                  GApplicationCommandLine *cmdline)
    {
      // keep the application running until we are done with this commandline
      g_application_hold (application);
    
      g_object_set_data_full (G_OBJECT (cmdline),
                              "application", application,
                              (GDestroyNotify)g_application_release);
    
      g_object_ref (cmdline);
      g_idle_add (my_cmdline_handler, cmdline);
    
      return 0;
    }
    ```
    
    In this example the commandline is not completely handled before
    the `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` handler returns. Instead, we keep
    a reference to the [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] object and handle it
    later (in this example, in an idle). Note that it is necessary to
    hold the application until you are done with the commandline.
