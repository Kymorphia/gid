/**
    [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] is a base class for implementing streaming output.
    
    It has functions to write to a stream ([gio.output_stream.OutputStream.write]),
    to close a stream ([gio.output_stream.OutputStream.close]) and to flush pending
    writes ([gio.output_stream.OutputStream.flush]).
    
    To copy the content of an input stream to an output stream without
    manually handling the reads and writes, use [gio.output_stream.OutputStream.splice].
    
    See the documentation for [gio.iostream.IOStream] for details of thread safety
    of streaming APIs.
    
    All of these functions have async variants too.
    
    All classes derived from [gio.output_stream.OutputStream] *should* implement synchronous
    writing, splicing, flushing and closing streams, but *may* implement
    asynchronous versions.

      Closes the stream, releasing resources related to it.
      
      Once the stream is closed, all other operations will return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed].
      Closing a stream multiple times will not return an error.
      
      Closing a stream will automatically flush any outstanding buffers in the
      stream.
      
      Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
      is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
      resources are released as early as possible.
      
      Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file descriptor)
      open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for the individual
      stream for details.
      
      On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the close
      operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed to
      close will still return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed] for all operations. Still, it
      is important to check and report the error to the user, otherwise
      there might be a loss of data as all data might not be written.
      
      If cancellable is not null, then the operation can be cancelled by
      triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
      was cancelled, the error [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Cancelled] will be returned.
      Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but there some streams
      can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors. On
      cancellation (as with any error) there is no guarantee that all written
      data will reach the target.
