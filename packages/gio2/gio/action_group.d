/**
    [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] represents a group of actions.
    
    Actions can be used to expose functionality in a structured way, either
    from one part of a program to another, or to the outside world. Action
    groups are often used together with a [gio.menu_model.MenuModel] that provides additional
    representation data for displaying the actions to the user, e.g. in a menu.
    
    The main way to interact with the actions in a [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] is to
    activate them with [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.activateAction]. Activating an
    action may require a [glib.variant.VariantG] parameter. The required type of the
    parameter can be inquired with [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionParameterType].
    Actions may be disabled, see [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionEnabled].
    Activating a disabled action has no effect.
    
    Actions may optionally have a state in the form of a #GVariant. The current
    state of an action can be inquired with [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionState].
    Activating a stateful action may change its state, but it is also possible to
    set the state by calling [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.changeActionState].
    
    As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an
    option to change the current font to 'bold'. A good way to represent
    this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
    action would toggle the state.
    
    Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
    method calls, except [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.listActions] take the name of
    an action as an argument.
    
    The [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
    group. The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
    forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
    with actions. 'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
    the action group implementation) are found on subclasses. This is
    why you will find - for example - [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.getActionEnabled]
    but not an equivalent set() call.
    
    Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
    on individual actions.
    
    Implementations of [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] should provide implementations for
    the virtual functions [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.listActions] and
    [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.queryAction]. The other virtual functions should
    not be implemented - their "wrappers" are actually implemented with
    calls to [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.queryAction].

      activation over D-Bus, this call may return before the relevant

      [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection.flush] should be called prior to the code, which

      the D-Bus connection, there is no guarantee that the action would

      example of a "quit" action being activated on the primary app
      instance over D-Bus. Here [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection.flush] is called
      before `exit()`. Without [gio.dbus_connection.DBusConnection.flush], the "quit" action
      may fail to be activated on the primary instance.

      different things about it.  The second is that implementing
      #GActionGroup can now be done by only overriding this one virtual
      function.
      
      The interface provides a default implementation of this function that
      calls the individual functions, as required, to fetch the
      information.  The interface also provides default implementations of
      those functions that call this function.  All implementations,
      therefore, must override either this function or all of the others.
