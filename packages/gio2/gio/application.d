/**
    [gio.application.Application] is the core class for application support.
    
    A [gio.application.Application] is the foundation of an application. It wraps some
    low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
    foundation for higher-level application classes such as
    [gtk.application.Application] or `MxApplication`. In general, you should not use
    this class outside of a higher level framework.
    
    [gio.application.Application] provides convenient life-cycle management by maintaining
    a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
    be changed using [gio.application.Application.hold] and
    [gio.application.Application.release]. If it drops to zero, the application
    exits. Higher-level classes such as [gtk.application.Application] employ the use count
    to ensure that the application stays alive as long as it has any opened
    windows.
    
    Another feature that [gio.application.Application] (optionally) provides is process
    uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
    providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
    with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
    concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
    desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
    arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
    running program. The already running instance of the program is
    called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
    always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
    is used for communication.
    
    The use of [gio.application.Application] differs from some other commonly-used
    uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
    application is not expected to manually register itself and check
    if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
    [gio.application.Application] should do very little more than instantiating the
    application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
    calling [gio.application.Application.run]. All checks for uniqueness are done
    internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
    startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
    is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
    instance and [gio.application.Application.run] promptly returns. See the code
    examples below.
    
    If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the
    same as that of a
    [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
    Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
    `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
    For details on valid application identifiers, see [gio.application.Application.idIsValid].
    
    On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
    on the user's session bus. This means that the uniqueness of your
    application is scoped to the current session. It also means that your
    application may provide additional services (through registration of other
    object paths) at that bus name. The registration of these object paths
    should be done with the shared GDBus session bus. Note that due to the
    internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
    (even if a main loop is not running). For this reason, you must ensure that
    any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
    attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
    [gio.application.Application.register]). Unfortunately, this means that you cannot
    use `property@Gio.Application:is-remote` to decide if you want to register
    object paths.
    
    [gio.application.Application] also implements the [gio.action_group.ActionGroup] and [gio.action_map.ActionMap]
    interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
    [gio.action_map.ActionMap.addAction]. When invoking an action by calling
    [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.activateAction] on the application, it is always
    invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
    the session bus, and GIO provides the [gio.dbus_action_group.DBusActionGroup] wrapper to
    conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a [gio.dbus_menu_model.DBusMenuModel] wrapper
    for remote access to exported [gio.menu_model.MenuModel]s.
    
    Note: Due to the fact that actions are exported on the session bus,
    using `maybe` parameters is not supported, since D-Bus does not support
    `maybe` types.
    
    There is a number of different entry points into a [gio.application.Application]:
    
    $(LIST
      * via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
      
      * via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
      
      * by handling a command-line
      
      * via activating an action
    )
      
    The [gio.application.Application.startup] signal lets you handle the application
    initialization for all of these in a single place.
    
    Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
    application, [gio.application.Application] passes some ‘platform data’ from the
    launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
    [glib.variant.Variant] dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
    data, override the `vfunc@Gio.Application.before_emit` or
    `vfunc@Gio.Application.after_emit` virtual functions
    in your [gio.application.Application] subclass. When dealing with
    [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine] objects, the platform data is
    directly available via [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getCwd],
    [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getEnviron] and
    [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getPlatformData].
    
    As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
    operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
    `cwd`), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
    variables and their values) of the calling process (key `environ`).
    The environment is only added to the platform data if the
    [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.SendEnvironment] flag is set. [gio.application.Application] subclasses
    can add their own platform data by overriding the
    `vfunc@Gio.Application.add_platform_data` virtual function. For instance,
    [gtk.application.Application] adds startup notification data in this way.
    
    To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
    `signal@Gio.Application::command-line` signal or override the
    `vfunc@Gio.Application.local_command_line` virtual funcion, to parse them in
    either the primary instance or the local instance, respectively.

      Application identifiers follow the same format as
      [D-Bus well-known bus names](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
      For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
      reproduced here:
      
      $(LIST
        * Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated by a
          period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one character.
        
        * Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
          with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
          begin with a digit.
        
        * Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
          (and thus at least two elements).
        
        * Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.
        
        * Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.
      )
        
      Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
      but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
      refer to D-Bus, such as
      [Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
      the
      [`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
      and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
      resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
      require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
      identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.
      
      Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
      reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
      it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
      words run together, with initial capital letters.
      
      As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
      hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
      contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
      For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an
      archiving application, it might be named `org._7_zip.Archiver`.

  /**
      Adds main option entries to be handled by application.
      
      This function is comparable to [glib.option_context.OptionContext.addMainEntries].
      
      After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
      #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted.  At this
      point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by arg_data
      in the given #GOptionEntrys.
      
      Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a null
      arg_data for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
      argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
      passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be
      inspected and modified.  If [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine] is
      set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
      where [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getOptionsDict] will return it.
      As it has been passed outside the process at this point, the types of all
      values in the options dict must be checked before being used.
      This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
      booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
      filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
      do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
      
      In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
      parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
      transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
      [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.lookup] can be used.  For local options, it is
      possible to either use arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and
      potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
      
      This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
      was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
      primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
      on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
      behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
      treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine] is unset.
      
      If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
      filenames, then the use of `G_OPTION_REMAINING` is recommended.  If
      arg_data is null then `G_OPTION_REMAINING` can be used as a key into
      the options dictionary.  If you do use `G_OPTION_REMAINING` then you
      need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
      consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
      (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
      
      It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
      the options with [glib.variant_dict.VariantDict.lookup]:
      $(LIST
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_NONE`, use `b`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_STRING`, use `&s`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_INT`, use `i`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_INT64`, use `x`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE`, use `d`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME`, use `^&ay`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY`, use `^a&s`
        * for `G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME_ARRAY`, use `^a&ay`
      )
  
      Params:
        entries = the
            main options for the application
  */
  void addMainOptionEntries(glib.types.OptionEntry[] entries)

  /**
      Adds a #GOptionGroup to the commandline handling of application.
      
      This function is comparable to [glib.option_context.OptionContext.addGroup].
      
      Unlike [gio.application.Application.addMainOptionEntries], this function does
      not deal with null arg_data and never transmits options to the
      primary instance.
      
      The reason for that is because, by the time the options arrive at the
      primary instance, it is typically too late to do anything with them.
      Taking the GTK option group as an example: GTK will already have been
      initialised by the time the #GApplication::command-line handler runs.
      In the case that this is not the first-running instance of the
      application, the existing instance may already have been running for
      a very long time.
      
      This means that the options from #GOptionGroup are only really usable
      in the case that the instance of the application being run is the
      first instance.  Passing options like `--display=` or `--gdk-debug=`
      on future runs will have no effect on the existing primary instance.
      
      Calling this function will cause the options in the supplied option
      group to be parsed, but it does not cause you to be "opted in" to the
      new functionality whereby unrecognised options are rejected even if
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine] was given.

      This is the point at which the application discovers if it is the

      primary instance.  This is implemented by attempting to acquire the
      application identifier as a unique bus name on the session bus using
      GDBus.
      
      If there is no application ID or if [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.NonUnique] was

      Due to the internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be

      this reason, you must ensure that any object paths that you wish to

  /**
      Runs the application.
      
      This function is intended to be run from main() and its return value
      is intended to be returned by main(). Although you are expected to pass
      the argc, argv parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
      to pass null if argv is not available or commandline handling is not
      required.  Note that on Windows, argc and argv are ignored, and
      g_win32_get_command_line() is called internally (for proper support
      of Unicode commandline arguments).
      
      #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
      can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
      [gio.application.Application.addMainOptionEntries].  After this, the
      #GApplication::handle-local-options signal is emitted, from which the
      application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
      
      #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
      such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
      desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
      A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
      by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
      the process.
      
      What happens next depends on the flags: if
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine] was specified then the remaining
      commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
      #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
      remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
      If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
      #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesOpen] was specified then the files are opened
      via the #GApplication::open signal.
      
      If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
      commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
      and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
      to return true from your local_command_line() implementation to
      suppress the default handling. See
      [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c]
      for an example.
      
      If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
      then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
      non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
      falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
      
      If the [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.IsService] flag is set, then the service will
      run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
      for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
      if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
      except in the case that [gio.application.Application.setInactivityTimeout] is in
      use.
      
      This function sets the prgname ([glib.global.setPrgname]), if not already set,
      to the basename of argv[0].
      
      Much like [glib.main_loop.MainLoop.run], this function will acquire the main context
      for the duration that the application is running.
      
      Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
      or launchers (ie: neither [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.IsService] or
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.IsLauncher] are given as flags) will check (from the
      default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
      was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
      commandline processing is interrupted and the
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.IsService] flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
      solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
      will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
      while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
      mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
      "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
      approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
      should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
      control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
      what their exit status will be.

  /**
      Connect to `HandleLocalOptions` signal.
  
      The ::handle-local-options signal is emitted on the local instance
      after the parsing of the commandline options has occurred.
      
      You can add options to be recognised during commandline option
      parsing using [gio.application.Application.addMainOptionEntries] and
      [gio.application.Application.addOptionGroup].
      
      Signal handlers can inspect options (along with values pointed to
      from the arg_data of an installed #GOptionEntrys) in order to
      decide to perform certain actions, including direct local handling
      (which may be useful for options like --version).
      
      In the event that the application is marked
      [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine] the "normal processing" will
      send the options dictionary to the primary instance where it can be
      read with [gio.application_command_line.ApplicationCommandLine.getOptionsDict].  The signal
      handler can modify the dictionary before returning, and the
      modified dictionary will be sent.
      
      In the event that [gio.types.ApplicationFlags.HandlesCommandLine] is not set,
      "normal processing" will treat the remaining uncollected command
      line arguments as filenames or URIs.  If there are no arguments,
      the application is activated by [gio.application.Application.activate].  One or
      more arguments results in a call to [gio.application.Application.open].
      
      If you want to handle the local commandline arguments for yourself
      by converting them to calls to [gio.application.Application.open] or
      [gio.action_group.ActionGroup.activateAction] then you must be sure to register
      the application first.  You should probably not call
      [gio.application.Application.activate] for yourself, however: just return -1 and
      allow the default handler to do it for you.  This will ensure that
      the `--gapplication-service` switch works properly (i.e. no activation
      in that case).
      
      Note that this signal is emitted from the default implementation of
      local_command_line().  If you override that function and don't
      chain up then this signal will never be emitted.
      
      You can override local_command_line() if you need more powerful
      capabilities than what is provided here, but this should not
      normally be required.
