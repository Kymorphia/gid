/**
    [gio.drive.Drive] represents a piece of hardware connected to the machine.
  It’s generally only created for removable hardware or hardware with
  removable media.
  
  [gio.drive.Drive] is a container class for [gio.volume.Volume] objects that stem from
  the same piece of media. As such, [gio.drive.Drive] abstracts a drive with
  (or without) removable media and provides operations for querying
  whether media is available, determining whether media change is
  automatically detected and ejecting the media.
  
  If the [gio.drive.Drive] reports that media isn’t automatically detected, one
  can poll for media; typically one should not do this periodically
  as a poll for media operation is potentially expensive and may
  spin up the drive creating noise.
  
  [gio.drive.Drive] supports starting and stopping drives with authentication
  support for the former. This can be used to support a diverse set
  of use cases including connecting/disconnecting iSCSI devices,
  powering down external disk enclosures and starting/stopping
  multi-disk devices such as RAID devices. Note that the actual
  semantics and side-effects of starting/stopping a [gio.drive.Drive] may vary
  according to implementation. To choose the correct verbs in e.g. a
  file manager, use [gio.drive.Drive.getStartStopType].
  
  For [porting from GnomeVFS](migrating-gnome-vfs.html) note that there is no
  equivalent of [gio.drive.Drive] in that API.
