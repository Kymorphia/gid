/**
    [gio.input_stream.InputStream] is a base class for implementing streaming input.
  
  It has functions to read from a stream ([gio.input_stream.InputStream.read]),
  to close a stream ([gio.input_stream.InputStream.close]) and to skip some content
  ([gio.input_stream.InputStream.skip]).
  
  To copy the content of an input stream to an output stream without
  manually handling the reads and writes, use [gio.output_stream.OutputStream.splice].
  
  See the documentation for [gio.iostream.IOStream] for details of thread safety
  of streaming APIs.
  
  All of these functions have async variants too.

    Once the stream is closed, all other operations will return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed].
    Closing a stream multiple times will not return an error.
    
    Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
    is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
    resources are released as early as possible.
    
    Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file descriptor)
    open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for the individual
    stream for details.
    
    On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the close
    operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed to
    close will still return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed] for all operations. Still, it
    is important to check and report the error to the user.
    
    If cancellable is not null, then the operation can be cancelled by
    triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
    was cancelled, the error [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Cancelled] will be returned.
    Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
    can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.
