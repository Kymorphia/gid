/**
    [gio.seekable.Seekable] is implemented by streams (implementations of
    [gio.input_stream.InputStream] or [gio.output_stream.OutputStream]) that support seeking.
    
    Seekable streams largely fall into two categories: resizable and
    fixed-size.
    
    [gio.seekable.Seekable] on fixed-sized streams is approximately the same as POSIX
    [`lseek()`](man:lseek(2)) on a block device (for example: attempting to seek
    past the end of the device is an error).  Fixed streams typically cannot be
    truncated.
    
    [gio.seekable.Seekable] on resizable streams is approximately the same as POSIX
    [`lseek()`](man:lseek(2)) on a normal file.  Seeking past the end and writing
    data will usually cause the stream to resize by introducing zero bytes.

      Seeks in the stream by the given offset, modified by type.
      
      Attempting to seek past the end of the stream will have different
      results depending on if the stream is fixed-sized or resizable.  If
      the stream is resizable then seeking past the end and then writing
      will result in zeros filling the empty space.  Seeking past the end
      of a resizable stream and reading will result in EOF.  Seeking past
      the end of a fixed-sized stream will fail.
      
      Any operation that would result in a negative offset will fail.
      
      If cancellable is not null, then the operation can be cancelled by
      triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
      was cancelled, the error [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Cancelled] will be returned.

      Returns: true if successful. If an error
