/**
    A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user’s
    session bus.
    
    Note that [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] modifies the user’s environment, calling
    [`setenv()`](man:setenv(3)). This is not thread-safe, so all [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus]
    calls should be completed before threads are spawned, or should have
    appropriate locking to ensure no access conflicts to environment variables
    shared between [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] and other threads.
    
    ## Creating unit tests using [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus]
    
    Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
    D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
    usually don’t activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
    target system. The [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] object makes this easier for us by taking care
    of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
    up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
    code tree.
    
    The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
    D-Bus daemon. Typically a `services` subdirectory of your `tests` directory
    is a good place to put this file.
    
    The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
    uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
    achieve this by adding a file such as `my-server.service.in` in the services
    directory and have it processed by configure.
    
    ```
    [D-BUS Service]
    Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
    Exec=@abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
    ```
    
    You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
    fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
    test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
    preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
    
    ```
    -DTEST_SERVICES=\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\"
    ```
    
    Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
    you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] scaffolding.
    
    An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
    here:
    [gdbus-test-fixture.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
    
    Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
    service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
    some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
    service uses [gio.settings.Settings] and installs a schema then it is important
    that your test service not load the schema in the ordinary installed location
    (chances are that your service and schema files are not yet installed, or
    worse; there is an older version of the schema file sitting in the install
    location).
    
    Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
    environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
    created by [gio.test_dbus.TestDBus] and then in turn inherited by any services the
    D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
    a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
    rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
    `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the in tree directory holding your schemas
    in the above `fixture_setup()` routine.
    
    The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This
    can be achieved by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running
    test cases, an autotools setup might do the following in the directory
    holding schemas:
    
    ```
        all-am:
                $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
    
        CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled
    ```
