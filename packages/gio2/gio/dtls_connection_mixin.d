/**
    [gio.dtls_connection.DtlsConnection] is the base DTLS connection class type, which wraps
    a [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] and provides DTLS encryption on top of it. Its
    subclasses, [gio.dtls_client_connection.DtlsClientConnection] and
    [gio.dtls_server_connection.DtlsServerConnection], implement client-side and server-side DTLS,
    respectively.
    
    For TLS support, see [gio.tls_connection.TlsConnection].
    
    As DTLS is datagram based, [gio.dtls_connection.DtlsConnection] implements
    [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased], presenting a datagram-socket-like API for the
    encrypted connection. This operates over a base datagram connection, which is
    also a [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] (`property@Gio.DtlsConnection:base-socket`).
    
    To close a DTLS connection, use [gio.dtls_connection.DtlsConnection.close].
    
    Neither [gio.dtls_server_connection.DtlsServerConnection] or [gio.dtls_client_connection.DtlsClientConnection]
    set the peer address on their base [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] if it is a
    [gio.socket.Socket] â€” it is up to the caller to do that if they wish. If they
    do not, and [gio.socket.Socket.close] is called on the base socket, the
    [gio.dtls_connection.DtlsConnection] will not raise a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.NotConnected] error on
    further I/O.

  /**
      Close the DTLS connection. This is equivalent to calling
      [gio.dtls_connection.DtlsConnection.shutdown] to shut down both sides of the connection.
      
      Closing a #GDtlsConnection waits for all buffered but untransmitted data to
      be sent before it completes. It then sends a `close_notify` DTLS alert to the
      peer and may wait for a `close_notify` to be received from the peer. It does
      not close the underlying #GDtlsConnection:base-socket; that must be closed
      separately.
      
      Once conn is closed, all other operations will return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed].
      Closing a #GDtlsConnection multiple times will not return an error.
      
      #GDtlsConnections will be automatically closed when the last reference is
      dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure resources are

  /**
      Connect to `AcceptCertificate` signal.
  
      Emitted during the TLS handshake after the peer certificate has
      been received. You can examine peer_cert's certification path by
      calling [gio.tls_certificate.TlsCertificate.getIssuer] on it.
      
      For a client-side connection, peer_cert is the server's
      certificate, and the signal will only be emitted if the
      certificate was not acceptable according to conn's
      #GDtlsClientConnection:validation_flags. If you would like the
      certificate to be accepted despite errors, return true from the
      signal handler. Otherwise, if no handler accepts the certificate,
      the handshake will fail with [gio.types.TlsError.BadCertificate].
      
      GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, this signal
      will be emitted with at least one error will be set in errors, but
      it does not guarantee that all possible errors will be set.
      Accordingly, you may not safely decide to ignore any particular
      type of error. For example, it would be incorrect to ignore
      [gio.types.TlsCertificateFlags.Expired] if you want to allow expired
      certificates, because this could potentially be the only error flag
      set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
      
      For a server-side connection, peer_cert is the certificate
      presented by the client, if this was requested via the server's
      #GDtlsServerConnection:authentication_mode. On the server side,
      the signal is always emitted when the client presents a
      certificate, and the certificate will only be accepted if a
      handler returns true.
      
      Note that if this signal is emitted as part of asynchronous I/O
      in the main thread, then you should not attempt to interact with
      the user before returning from the signal handler. If you want to
      let the user decide whether or not to accept the certificate, you
      would have to return false from the signal handler on the first
      attempt, and then after the connection attempt returns a
      [gio.types.TlsError.BadCertificate], you can interact with the user, and
      if the user decides to accept the certificate, remember that fact,
      create a new connection, and return true from the signal handler
      the next time.
      
      If you are doing I/O in another thread, you do not
      need to worry about this, and can simply block in the signal
      handler until the UI thread returns an answer.

        callback = signal callback delegate or function to connect

          `Returns` true to accept peer_cert (which will also
          immediately end the signal emission). false to allow the signal
          emission to continue, which will cause the handshake to fail if
          no one else overrides it.
