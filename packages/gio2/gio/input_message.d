/**
    Structure used for scatter/gather data input when receiving multiple
    messages or packets in one go. You generally pass in an array of empty
    #GInputVectors and the operation will use all the buffers as if they
    were one buffer, and will set @bytes_received to the total number of bytes
    received across all #GInputVectors.
    
    This structure closely mirrors `struct mmsghdr` and `struct msghdr` from
    the POSIX sockets API (see `man 2 recvmmsg`).
    
    If @address is non-null then it is set to the source address the message
    was received from, and the caller must free it afterwards.
    
    If @control_messages is non-null then it is set to an array of control
    messages received with the message (if any), and the caller must free it
    afterwards. @num_control_messages is set to the number of elements in
    this array, which may be zero.
    
    Flags relevant to this message will be returned in @flags. For example,
    `MSG_EOR` or `MSG_TRUNC`.
