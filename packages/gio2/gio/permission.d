/**
    A [gio.permission.Permission] represents the status of the caller’s permission to
    perform a certain action.
    
    You can query if the action is currently allowed and if it is
    possible to acquire the permission so that the action will be allowed
    in the future.
    
    There is also an API to actually acquire the permission and one to
    release it.
    
    As an example, a [gio.permission.Permission] might represent the ability for the
    user to write to a [gio.settings.Settings] object.  This [gio.permission.Permission] object
    could then be used to decide if it is appropriate to show a “Click here to
    unlock” button in a dialog and to provide the mechanism to invoke
    when that button is clicked.
