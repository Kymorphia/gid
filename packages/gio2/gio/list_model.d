/**
    [gio.list_model.ListModel] is an interface that represents a mutable list of
  [gobject.object.ObjectG]. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets
  in user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
  convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
  updates.
  
  Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
  mechanism (normally the [gobject.object.ObjectG.notify] signal).  Taken
  together with the `signal@Gio.ListModel::items-changed` signal, this provides
  for a list that can change its membership, and in which the members can
  change their individual properties.
  
  A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
  points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
  signal strength.
  
  It is important to note that the [gio.list_model.ListModel] itself does not report
  changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
  membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
  then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
  interested in.
  
  All items in a [gio.list_model.ListModel] are of (or derived from) the same type.
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItemType] returns that type.  The type may be an
  interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
  
  The semantics are close to that of an array:
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getNItems] returns the number of items in the list
  and [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItem] returns an item at a (0-based) position.
  In order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
  you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItem] until it returns `NULL`.
  
  An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
  return the same object for a given position until all references to
  it are gone.
  
  On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
  objects that are currently ‘user visible’, in order to facilitate the
  maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
  reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
  
  This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
  thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
  implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
  the thread-default main context (see
  [glib.main_context.MainContext.pushThreadDefault]) in effect at the time that the
  model was created.
  
  Over time, it has established itself as good practice for list model
  implementations to provide properties `item-type` and `n-items` to
  ease working with them. While it is not required, it is recommended
  that implementations provide these two properties. They should return
  the values of [gio.list_model.ListModel.getItemType] and
  [gio.list_model.ListModel.getNItems] respectively and be defined as such:
  
  ```c
  properties[PROP_ITEM_TYPE] =
    g_param_spec_gtype ("item-type", NULL, NULL, G_TYPE_OBJECT,
                        G_PARAM_CONSTRUCT_ONLY | G_PARAM_READWRITE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
  properties[PROP_N_ITEMS] =
    g_param_spec_uint ("n-items", NULL, NULL, 0, G_MAXUINT, 0,
                       G_PARAM_READABLE | G_PARAM_STATIC_STRINGS);
  ```

  /**
      Emits the #GListModel::items-changed signal on list.
    
    This function should only be called by classes implementing
    #GListModel. It has to be called after the internal representation
    of list has been updated, because handlers connected to this signal
    might query the new state of the list.
    
    Implementations must only make changes to the model (as visible to
    its consumer) in places that will not cause problems for that
    consumer.  For models that are driven directly by a write API (such
    as #GListStore), changes can be reported in response to uses of that
    API.  For models that represent remote data, changes should only be
    made from a fresh mainloop dispatch.  It is particularly not
    permitted to make changes in response to a call to the #GListModel
    consumer API.
    
    Stated another way: in general, it is assumed that code making a
    series of accesses to the model via the API, without returning to the
    mainloop, and without calling other code, will continue to view the
    same contents of the model.
