      Possibly copies session state from one connection to another, for use
      in TLS session resumption. This is not normally needed, but may be
      used when the same session needs to be used between different
      endpoints, as is required by some protocols, such as FTP over TLS.
      source should have already completed a handshake and, since TLS 1.3,
      it should have been used to read data at least once. conn should not
      have completed a handshake.
      
      It is not possible to know whether a call to this function will
      actually do anything. Because session resumption is normally used
      only for performance benefit, the TLS backend might not implement
      this function. Even if implemented, it may not actually succeed in
      allowing conn to resume source's TLS session, because the server
      may not have sent a session resumption token to source, or it may
      refuse to accept the token from conn. There is no way to know
      whether a call to this function is actually successful.
      
      Using this function is not required to benefit from session
      resumption. If the TLS backend supports session resumption, the
      session will be resumed automatically if it is possible to do so
      without weakening the privacy guarantees normally provided by TLS,
      without need to call this function. For example, with TLS 1.3,
      a session ticket will be automatically copied from any
      #GTlsClientConnection that has previously received session tickets
      from the server, provided a ticket is available that has not
      previously been used for session resumption, since session ticket
      reuse would be a privacy weakness. Using this function causes the
      ticket to be copied without regard for privacy considerations.
