  /**
      Emitted when the operation has been cancelled.
    
    Can be used by implementations of cancellable operations. If the
    operation is cancelled from another thread, the signal will be
    emitted in the thread that cancelled the operation, not the
    thread that is running the operation.
    
    Note that disconnecting from this signal (or any signal) in a
    multi-threaded program is prone to race conditions. For instance
    it is possible that a signal handler may be invoked even after
    a call to [gobject.global.signalHandlerDisconnect] for that handler has
    already returned.
    
    There is also a problem when cancellation happens right before
    connecting to the signal. If this happens the signal will
    unexpectedly not be emitted, and checking before connecting to
    the signal leaves a race condition where this is still happening.
    
    In order to make it safe and easy to connect handlers there
    are two helper functions: [gio.cancellable.Cancellable.connect] and
    [gio.cancellable.Cancellable.disconnect] which protect against problems
    like this.
    
    An example of how to us this:
    ```c
        // Make sure we don't do unnecessary work if already cancelled
        if (g_cancellable_set_error_if_cancelled (cancellable, error))
          return;
    
        // Set up all the data needed to be able to handle cancellation
        // of the operation
        my_data = my_data_new (...);
    
        id = 0;
        if (cancellable)
          id = g_cancellable_connect (cancellable,
        			      G_CALLBACK (cancelled_handler)
        			      data, NULL);
    
        // cancellable operation here...
    
        g_cancellable_disconnect (cancellable, id);
    
        // cancelled_handler is never called after this, it is now safe
        // to free the data
        my_data_free (my_data);
    ```
    
    Note that the cancelled signal is emitted in the thread that
    the user cancelled from, which may be the main thread. So, the
    cancellable signal should not do something that can block.
