/**
    [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream] is implemented by [gio.output_stream.OutputStream]s that
    can be polled for readiness to write. This can be used when
    interfacing with a non-GIO API that expects
    UNIX-file-descriptor-style asynchronous I/O rather than GIO-style.
    
    Some classes may implement [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream] but have only certain
    instances of that class be pollable. If [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream.canPoll]
    returns false, then the behavior of other [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream] methods is
    undefined.
