    [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream] is implemented by [gio.output_stream.OutputStream]s that
  can be polled for readiness to write. This can be used when
  interfacing with a non-GIO API that expects
  UNIX-file-descriptor-style asynchronous I/O rather than GIO-style.
  
  Some classes may implement [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream] but have only certain
  instances of that class be pollable. If [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream.canPoll]
  returns false, then the behavior of other [gio.pollable_output_stream.PollableOutputStream] methods is
