    [gio.converter.Converter] is an interface for streaming conversions.
  
  [gio.converter.Converter] is implemented by objects that convert
  binary data in various ways. The conversion can be
  stateful and may fail at any place.
  
  Some example conversions are: character set conversion,
  compression, decompression and regular expression
  replace.

  /**
      This is the main operation used when converting data. It is to be called
    multiple times in a loop, and each time it will do some work, i.e.
    producing some output (in outbuf) or consuming some input (from inbuf) or
    both. If its not possible to do any work an error is returned.
    
    Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).
    Also a call may produce output even if given no input, due to state stored
    in the converter producing output.
    
    If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
    only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
    next call.
    
    A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
    giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
    data after the data in inbuf, the flag [gio.types.ConverterFlags.InputAtEnd] must be set.
    The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning [gio.types.ConverterResult.Converted]
    each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
    [gio.types.ConverterResult.Finished] is returned instead. Note, that [gio.types.ConverterResult.Finished]
    may be returned even if [gio.types.ConverterFlags.InputAtEnd] is not set, for instance
    in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
    data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
    
    When some data has successfully been converted bytes_read and is set to
    the number of bytes read from inbuf, and bytes_written is set to indicate
    how many bytes was written to outbuf. If there are more data to output
    or consume (i.e. unless the [gio.types.ConverterFlags.InputAtEnd] is specified) then
    [gio.types.ConverterResult.Converted] is returned, and if no more data is to be output
    then [gio.types.ConverterResult.Finished] is returned.
    
    On error [gio.types.ConverterResult.Error] is returned and error is set accordingly.
    Some errors need special handling:
    
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.NoSpace] is returned if there is not enough space
    to write the resulting converted data, the application should
    call the function again with a larger outbuf to continue.
    
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.PartialInput] is returned if there is not enough
    input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
    and the [gio.types.ConverterFlags.InputAtEnd] flag is not set. This happens for
    example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
    or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
    further input). It may also happen when inbuf_size is zero and
    there is no more data to produce.
    
    When this happens the application should read more input and then
    call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
    more data call the function again with the same data but with
    the [gio.types.ConverterFlags.InputAtEnd] flag set. This may cause the conversion
    to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.PartialInput] in e.g. a charset conversion where the
    input is actually partial).
    
    After [gio.converter.Converter.convert] has returned [gio.types.ConverterResult.Finished] the
    converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
    to call [gio.converter.Converter.convert] anymore. At this time you can only
    free the object or call [gio.converter.Converter.reset] to reset it to the
    initial state.
    
    If the flag [gio.types.ConverterFlags.Flush] is set then conversion is modified
    to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
    has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
    the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
    been produced then [gio.types.ConverterResult.Flushed] (or [gio.types.ConverterResult.Finished] if
    really at the end) is returned instead of [gio.types.ConverterResult.Converted].
    This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
    but done in the middle of the data.
    
    This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
    in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
    compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
    compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
    make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
    is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
    have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
    non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
    treat this as the end of input and do the match.
    
    Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
    at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
    to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
    (typically [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.PartialInput]).
    Params:
      inbuf =       the buffer
                containing the data to convert.
      outbuf =       a
           buffer to write converted data in.
      flags =       a #GConverterFlags controlling the conversion details
      bytesRead =       will be set to the number of bytes read
           from inbuf on success
      bytesWritten =       will be set to the number of bytes
           written to outbuf on success
    Returns:     a #GConverterResult, [gio.types.ConverterResult.Error] on error.
