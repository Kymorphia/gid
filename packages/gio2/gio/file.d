/**
    [gio.file.File] is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
    virtual file system. [gio.file.File]s are lightweight, immutable objects
    that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
    [gio.file.File] objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
    file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
    (see [gio.input_stream.InputStream] and [gio.output_stream.OutputStream]).
    
    To construct a [gio.file.File], you can use:
    
    $(LIST
      * [gio.file.File.newForPath] if you have a path.
      * [gio.file.File.newForUri] if you have a URI.
      * [gio.file.File.newForCommandlineArg] or
        [gio.file.File.newForCommandlineArgAndCwd] for a command line
        argument.
      * [gio.file.File.newTmp] to create a temporary file from a template.
      * [gio.file.File.newTmpAsync] to asynchronously create a temporary file.
      * [gio.file.File.newTmpDirAsync] to asynchronously create a temporary
        directory.
      * [gio.file.File.parseName] from a UTF-8 string gotten from
        [gio.file.File.getParseName].
      * [gio.file.File.newBuildFilename] or [gio.file.File.newBuildFilenamev]
        to create a file from path elements.
    )
      
    One way to think of a [gio.file.File] is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
    normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
    [gio.file.File]s are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
    to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
    
    [gio.file.File]s make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
    the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
    [gio.file.File] using [gio.file.File.getParent] to get an identifier for the
    parent directory, [gio.file.File.getChild] to get a child within a
    directory, and [gio.file.File.resolveRelativePath] to resolve a relative
    path between two [gio.file.File]s. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not
    end up at the same root if you repeatedly call [gio.file.File.getParent]
    on two different files.
    
    All [gio.file.File]s have a basename (get with [gio.file.File.getBasename]). These
    names are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
    (relative to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they
    have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
    you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
    name that you can get by requesting the
    `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME` attribute with
    [gio.file.File.queryInfo]. This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be
    used in a user interface. But always store the real basename or the [gio.file.File]
    to use to actually access the file, because there is no way to go from a
    display name to the actual name.
    
    Using [gio.file.File] as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
    in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
    hard or soft links may cause two different [gio.file.File]s to refer to the same
    file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
    short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
    check if two [gio.file.File]s point to the same file you can query for the
    `G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE` attribute. Note that [gio.file.File] does some trivial
    canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
    the path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of
    path, `.` or `..` path segments, etc) does not create different [gio.file.File]s.
    
    Many [gio.file.File] operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
    to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
    simply have `_async()` appended to their function names. The asynchronous
    I/O functions call a [gio.types.AsyncReadyCallback] which is then used to
    finalize the operation, producing a [gio.async_result.AsyncResult] which is then
    passed to the function’s matching `_finish()` operation.
    
    It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
    shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
    I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
    Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the
    [introduction to asynchronous programming section](overview.html#asynchronous-programming)
    for more.
    
    Some [gio.file.File] operations almost always take a noticeable amount of time, and
    so do not have synchronous analogs. Notable cases include:
    
    $(LIST
      * [gio.file.File.mountMountable] to mount a mountable file.
      * [gio.file.File.unmountMountableWithOperation] to unmount a mountable
        file.
      * [gio.file.File.ejectMountableWithOperation] to eject a mountable file.
    )
      
    ## Entity Tags
    
    One notable feature of [gio.file.File]s are entity tags, or ‘etags’ for
    short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
    traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file
    has been modified from the version on the file system. See the
    HTTP 1.1
    [specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)
    for HTTP `ETag` headers, which are a very similar concept.

      Utility function to check if a particular file exists. This is

      and then execute something based on the outcome of that, because the
      file might have been created or removed in between the operations. The
      general approach to handling that is to not check, but just do the
      operation and handle the errors as they come.
      
      As an example of race-free checking, take the case of reading a file,
      and if it doesn't exist, creating it. There are two racy versions: read
      it, and on error create it; and: check if it exists, if not create it.
      These can both result in two processes creating the file (with perhaps
      a partially written file as the result). The correct approach is to
      always try to create the file with [gio.file.File.create] which will either
      atomically create the file or fail with a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Exists] error.

      for instance to make a menu item sensitive/insensitive, so that you don't
      have to fool users that something is possible and then just show an error
      dialog. If you do this, you should make sure to also handle the errors
      that can happen due to races when you execute the operation.
