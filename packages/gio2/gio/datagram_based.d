/**
    Interface for socket-like objects with datagram semantics.
  
  A [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
  communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
  BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
  [gio.socket.Socket], which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
  
  [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
  alongside higher-level networking APIs such as [gio.iostream.IOStream].
  
  It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
  to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
  the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
  or system calls. For example, [gio.socket.Socket] uses `recvmmsg()` and `sendmmsg()`
  where possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
  multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
  assemble or disassemble a message.
  
  Each [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
  for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
  timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
  error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
  [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
  will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
  timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
  [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.TimedOut] if no progress was made. To know when a call would
  successfully run you can call [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] or
  [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionWait]. You can also use
  [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.createSource] and attach it to a [glib.main_context.MainContext]
  to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
  
  When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
  handle getting a [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] error even when some other function
  said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
  condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
  instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
  returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
  
  As with [gio.socket.Socket], [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased]s can be either connection oriented (for
  example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased]s must be
  datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
  establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
  before sending and receiving data through the [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] API. For
  connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
  received in each I/O operation.
  
  Like most other APIs in GLib, [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] is not inherently thread safe.
  To use a [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased] concurrently from multiple threads, you must
  implement your own locking.

  /**
      Checks on the readiness of datagram_based to perform operations. The
    operations specified in condition are checked for and masked against the
    currently-satisfied conditions on datagram_based. The result is returned.
    
    [glib.types.IOCondition.In] will be set in the return value if data is available to read with
    [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.receiveMessages], or if the connection is closed remotely
    (EOS); and if the datagram_based has not been closed locally using some
    implementation-specific method (such as [gio.socket.Socket.close] or
    [gio.socket.Socket.shutdown] with shutdown_read set, if it’s a #GSocket).
    
    If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling [gio.socket.Socket.close] or
    [gio.socket.Socket.shutdown] with shutdown_read set, if it’s a #GSocket, for
    example), all calls to this function will return [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.Closed].
    
    [glib.types.IOCondition.Out] will be set if it is expected that at least one byte can be sent
    using [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.sendMessages] without blocking. It will not be set
    if the datagram_based has been closed locally.
    
    [glib.types.IOCondition.Hup] will be set if the connection has been closed locally.
    
    [glib.types.IOCondition.Err] will be set if there was an asynchronous error in transmitting data
    previously enqueued using [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.sendMessages].
    
    Note that on Windows, it is possible for an operation to return
    [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock] even immediately after
    [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] has claimed that the #GDatagramBased is
    ready for writing. Rather than calling [gio.datagram_based.DatagramBased.conditionCheck] and
    then writing to the #GDatagramBased if it succeeds, it is generally better to
    simply try writing right away, and try again later if the initial attempt
    returns [gio.types.IOErrorEnum.WouldBlock].
    
    It is meaningless to specify [glib.types.IOCondition.Err] or [glib.types.IOCondition.Hup] in condition; these
    conditions will always be set in the output if they are true. Apart from
    these flags, the output is guaranteed to be masked by condition.
    
    This call never blocks.

    The callback on the source is of the #GDatagramBasedSourceFunc type.
