/**
    The [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] interface defines a generic interface for
    non-strictly-typed data that is stored in a hierarchy. To implement
    an alternative storage backend for [gio.settings.Settings], you need to
    implement the [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] interface and then make it implement the
    extension point `G_SETTINGS_BACKEND_EXTENSION_POINT_NAME`.
    
    The interface defines methods for reading and writing values, a
    method for determining if writing of certain values will fail
    (lockdown) and a change notification mechanism.
    
    The semantics of the interface are very precisely defined and
    implementations must carefully adhere to the expectations of
    callers that are documented on each of the interface methods.
    
    Some of the [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] functions accept or return a
    [glib.tree.Tree]. These trees always have strings as keys and
    [glib.variant.Variant] as values.
    
    The [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend] API is exported to allow third-party
    implementations, but does not carry the same stability guarantees
    as the public GIO API. For this reason, you have to define the
    C preprocessor symbol `G_SETTINGS_ENABLE_BACKEND` before including
    `gio/gsettingsbackend.h`.

      Signals that a single key has possibly changed.  Backend
      implementations should call this if a key has possibly changed its
      value.
      
      key must be a valid key (ie starting with a slash, not containing
      '//', and not ending with a slash).
      
      The implementation must call this function during any call to
      g_settings_backend_write(), before the call returns (except in the
      case that no keys are actually changed and it cares to detect this
      fact).  It may not rely on the existence of a mainloop for
      dispatching the signal later.
      
      The implementation may call this function at any other time it likes
      in response to other events (such as changes occurring outside of the
      program).  These calls may originate from a mainloop or may originate
      in response to any other action (including from calls to
      g_settings_backend_write()).
      
      In the case that this call is in response to a call to
      g_settings_backend_write() then origin_tag must be set to the same
      value that was passed to that call.

      Signals that a list of keys have possibly changed.  Backend

      values.
      
      path must be a valid path (ie starting and ending with a slash and
      not containing '//').  Each string in items must form a valid key
      name when path is prefixed to it (ie: each item must not start or
      end with '/' and must not contain '//').
      
      The meaning of this signal is that any of the key names resulting
      from the contatenation of path with each item in items may have
      changed.
      
      The same rules for when notifications must occur apply as per
      [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend.changed].  These two calls can be used
      interchangeably if exactly one item has changed (although in that
      case [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend.changed] is definitely preferred).
      
      For efficiency reasons, the implementation should strive for path to
      be as long as possible (ie: the longest common prefix of all of the
      keys that were changed) but this is not strictly required.

      The meaning of this signal is that any of the key which has a name

      The same rules for when notifications must occur apply as per
      [gio.settings_backend.SettingsBackend.changed].  This call might be an appropriate
      reasponse to a 'reset' call but implementations are also free to
      explicitly list the keys that were affected by that call if they can
      easily do so.
