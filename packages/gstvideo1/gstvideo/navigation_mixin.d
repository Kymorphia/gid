/**
    The Navigation interface is used for creating and injecting navigation
  related events such as mouse button presses, cursor motion and key presses.
  The associated library also provides methods for parsing received events, and
  for sending and receiving navigation related bus events. One main usecase is
  DVD menu navigation.
  
  The main parts of the API are:
  
  $(LIST
    * The GstNavigation interface, implemented by elements which provide an
      application with the ability to create and inject navigation events into
      the pipeline.
    * GstNavigation event handling API. GstNavigation events are created in
      response to calls on a GstNavigation interface implementation, and sent in
      the pipeline. Upstream elements can use the navigation event API functions
      to parse the contents of received messages.
    
    * GstNavigation message handling API. GstNavigation messages may be sent on
      the message bus to inform applications of navigation related changes in the
      pipeline, such as the mouse moving over a clickable region, or the set of
      available angles changing.
  )
    
  The GstNavigation message functions provide functions for creating and
  parsing custom bus messages for signaling GstNavigation changes.
